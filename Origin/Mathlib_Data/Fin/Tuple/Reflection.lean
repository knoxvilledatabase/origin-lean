# Lemmas for tuples `Fin m → α`

This file contains alternative definitions of common operators on vectors which expand
definitionally to the expected expression when evaluated on `![]` notation.

This allows "proof by reflection", where we prove `f = ![f 0, f 1]` by defining
`FinVec.etaExpand f` to be equal to the RHS definitionally, and then prove that
`f = etaExpand f`.

The definitions in this file should normally not be used directly; the intent is for the
corresponding `*_eq` lemmas to be used in a place where they are definitionally unfolded.

## Main definitions

* `FinVec.seq`
* `FinVec.map`
* `FinVec.sum`
* `FinVec.etaExpand`
