# Extended non-negative reals

We define `ENNReal = ℝ≥0∞ := WithTop ℝ≥0` to be the type of extended nonnegative real numbers,
i.e., the interval `[0, +∞]`. This type is used as the codomain of a `MeasureTheory.Measure`,
and of the extended distance `edist` in an `EMetricSpace`.

In this file we set up many of the instances on `ℝ≥0∞`, and provide relationships between `ℝ≥0∞` and
`ℝ≥0`, and between `ℝ≥0∞` and `ℝ`. In particular, we provide a coercion from `ℝ≥0` to `ℝ≥0∞` as well
as functions `ENNReal.toNNReal`, `ENNReal.ofReal` and `ENNReal.toReal`, all of which take the value
zero wherever they cannot be the identity. Also included is the relationship between `ℝ≥0∞` and `ℕ`.
The interaction of these functions, especially `ENNReal.ofReal` and `ENNReal.toReal`, with the
algebraic and lattice structure can be found in `Data.ENNReal.Real`.

This file proves many of the order properties of `ℝ≥0∞`, with the exception of the ways those relate
to the algebraic structure, which are included in `Data.ENNReal.Operations`.
This file also defines inversion and division: this includes `Inv` and `Div` instances on `ℝ≥0∞`
making it into a `DivInvOneMonoid`.
As a consequence of being a `DivInvOneMonoid`, `ℝ≥0∞` inherits a power operation with integer
exponent: this and other properties is shown in `Data.ENNReal.Inv`.


## Main definitions

* `ℝ≥0∞`: the extended nonnegative real numbers `[0, ∞]`; defined as `WithTop ℝ≥0`; it is
  equipped with the following structures:

  - coercion from `ℝ≥0` defined in the natural way;

  - the natural structure of a complete dense linear order: `↑p ≤ ↑q ↔ p ≤ q` and `∀ a, a ≤ ∞`;

  - `a + b` is defined so that `↑p + ↑q = ↑(p + q)` for `(p q : ℝ≥0)` and `a + ∞ = ∞ + a = ∞`;

  - `a * b` is defined so that `↑p * ↑q = ↑(p * q)` for `(p q : ℝ≥0)`, `0 * ∞ = ∞ * 0 = 0`, and
    `a * ∞ = ∞ * a = ∞` for `a ≠ 0`;

  - `a - b` is defined as the minimal `d` such that `a ≤ d + b`; this way we have
    `↑p - ↑q = ↑(p - q)`, `∞ - ↑p = ∞`, `↑p - ∞ = ∞ - ∞ = 0`; note that there is no negation, only
    subtraction;

  The addition and multiplication defined this way together with `0 = ↑0` and `1 = ↑1` turn
  `ℝ≥0∞` into a canonically ordered commutative semiring of characteristic zero.

  - `a⁻¹` is defined as `Inf {b | 1 ≤ a * b}`. This way we have `(↑p)⁻¹ = ↑(p⁻¹)` for
    `p : ℝ≥0`, `p ≠ 0`, `0⁻¹ = ∞`, and `∞⁻¹ = 0`.
  - `a / b` is defined as `a * b⁻¹`.

  This inversion and division include `Inv` and `Div` instances on `ℝ≥0∞`,
  making it into a `DivInvOneMonoid`. Further properties of these are shown in `Data.ENNReal.Inv`.

* Coercions to/from other types:

  - coercion `ℝ≥0 → ℝ≥0∞` is defined as `Coe`, so one can use `(p : ℝ≥0)` in a context that
    expects `a : ℝ≥0∞`, and Lean will apply `coe` automatically;

  - `ENNReal.toNNReal` sends `↑p` to `p` and `∞` to `0`;

  - `ENNReal.toReal := coe ∘ ENNReal.toNNReal` sends `↑p`, `p : ℝ≥0` to `(↑p : ℝ)` and `∞` to `0`;

  - `ENNReal.ofReal := coe ∘ Real.toNNReal` sends `x : ℝ` to `↑⟨max x 0, _⟩`

  - `ENNReal.neTopEquivNNReal` is an equivalence between `{a : ℝ≥0∞ // a ≠ 0}` and `ℝ≥0`.

## Implementation notes

We define a `CanLift ℝ≥0∞ ℝ≥0` instance, so one of the ways to prove theorems about an `ℝ≥0∞`
number `a` is to consider the cases `a = ∞` and `a ≠ ∞`, and use the tactic `lift a to ℝ≥0 using ha`
in the second case. This instance is even more useful if one already has `ha : a ≠ ∞` in the
context, or if we have `(f : α → ℝ≥0∞) (hf : ∀ x, f x ≠ ∞)`.

## Notation

* `ℝ≥0∞`: the type of the extended nonnegative real numbers;
* `ℝ≥0`: the type of nonnegative real numbers `[0, ∞)`; defined in `Data.Real.NNReal`;
* `∞`: a localized notation in `ENNReal` for `⊤ : ℝ≥0∞`.
