# Partial well ordering on finsupps

This file contains the fact that finitely supported functions from a fintype are
partially well ordered when the codomain is a linear order that is well ordered.
It is in a separate file for now so as to not add imports to the file `Order.WellFoundedSet`.

## Main statements

* `Finsupp.isPWO` - finitely supported functions from a fintype are partially well ordered when
  the codomain is a linear order that is well ordered

## Tags
