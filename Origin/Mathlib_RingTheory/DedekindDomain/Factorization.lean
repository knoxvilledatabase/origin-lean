# Factorization of ideals and fractional ideals of Dedekind domains

Every nonzero ideal `I` of a Dedekind domain `R` can be factored as a product `∏_v v^{n_v}` over the
maximal ideals of `R`, where the exponents `n_v` are natural numbers.

Similarly, every nonzero fractional ideal `I` of a Dedekind domain `R` can be factored as a product
`∏_v v^{n_v}` over the maximal ideals of `R`, where the exponents `n_v` are integers. We define
`FractionalIdeal.count K v I` (abbreviated as `val_v(I)` in the documentation) to be `n_v`, and we
prove some of its properties. If `I = 0`, we define `val_v(I) = 0`.

## Main definitions
- `FractionalIdeal.count` : If `I` is a nonzero fractional ideal, `a ∈ R`, and `J` is an ideal of
  `R` such that `I = a⁻¹J`, then we define `val_v(I)` as `(val_v(J) - val_v(a))`. If `I = 0`, we
  set `val_v(I) = 0`.

## Main results
- `Ideal.finite_factors` : Only finitely many maximal ideals of `R` divide a given nonzero ideal.
- `Ideal.finprod_heightOneSpectrum_factorization` : The ideal `I` equals the finprod
  `∏_v v^(val_v(I))`, where `val_v(I)` denotes the multiplicity of `v` in the factorization of `I`
  and `v` runs over the maximal ideals of `R`.
- `FractionalIdeal.finprod_heightOneSpectrum_factorization` : If `I` is a nonzero fractional ideal,
  `a ∈ R`, and `J` is an ideal of `R` such that `I = a⁻¹J`, then `I` is equal to the product
  `∏_v v^(val_v(J) - val_v(a))`.
- `FractionalIdeal.finprod_heightOneSpectrum_factorization'` : If `I` is a nonzero fractional
  ideal, then `I` is equal to the product `∏_v v^(val_v(I))`.
- `FractionalIdeal.finprod_heightOneSpectrum_factorization_principal` : For a nonzero `k = r/s ∈ K`,
  the fractional ideal `(k)` is equal to the product `∏_v v^(val_v(r) - val_v(s))`.
- `FractionalIdeal.finite_factors` : If `I ≠ 0`, then `val_v(I) = 0` for all but finitely many
  maximal ideals of `R`.
- `IsDedekindDomain.exists_sup_span_eq`: For all ideals `0 < I ≤ J`,
  there exists `a` such that `J = I + ⟨a⟩`.
- `Ideal.map_algebraMap_eq_finset_prod_pow`: if `p` is a maximal ideal, then the lift of `p`
  in an extension is the product of the primes over `p` to the power the ramification index.

## Implementation notes
Since we are only interested in the factorization of nonzero fractional ideals, we define
`val_v(0) = 0` so that every `val_v` is in `ℤ` and we can avoid having to use `WithTop ℤ`.
