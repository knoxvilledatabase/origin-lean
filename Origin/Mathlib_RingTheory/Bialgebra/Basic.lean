# Bialgebras

In this file we define `Bialgebra`s.

## Main definitions

* `Bialgebra R A`: the structure of a bialgebra on the `R`-algebra `A`;
* `CommSemiring.toBialgebra`: a commutative semiring is a bialgebra over itself.

## Implementation notes

Rather than the "obvious" axiom `∀ a b, counit (a * b) = counit a * counit b`, the far
more convoluted `mul_compr₂_counit` is used as a structure field; this says that
the corresponding two maps `A →ₗ[R] A →ₗ[R] R` are equal; a similar trick is
used for comultiplication as well. An alternative constructor `Bialgebra.mk'` is provided
with the more easily-readable axioms. The argument for using the more convoluted axioms
is that in practice there is evidence that they will be easier to prove (especially
when dealing with things like tensor products of bialgebras). This does make the definition
more surprising to mathematicians, however mathlib is no stranger to definitions which
are surprising to mathematicians -- see for example its definition of a group.
Note that this design decision is also compatible with that of `Coalgebra`. The lengthy
docstring for these convoluted fields attempts to explain what is going on.

The constructor `Bialgebra.ofAlgHom` is dual to the default constructor: For `R` is a commutative
semiring and `A` an `R`-algebra, it consumes the counit and comultiplication as algebra
homomorphisms that satisfy the coalgebra axioms to define a bialgebra structure on `A`.

class Bialgebra (R : Type u) (A : Type v) [CommSemiring R] [Semiring A] extends
    Algebra R A, Coalgebra R A where
  -- The counit is an algebra morphism
  /-- The counit on a bialgebra preserves 1. -/
  counit_one : counit 1 = 1
  /-- The counit on a bialgebra preserves multiplication. Note that this is written
  in a rather obscure way: it says that two bilinear maps `A →ₗ[R] A →ₗ[R]` are equal.
  The two corresponding equal linear maps `A ⊗[R] A →ₗ[R]`
  are the following: the first factors through `A` and is multiplication on `A` followed
  by `counit`. The second factors through `R ⊗[R] R`, and is `counit ⊗ counit` followed by
  multiplication on `R`.

  See `Bialgebra.mk'` for a constructor for bialgebras which uses
  the more familiar but mathematically equivalent `counit (a * b) = counit a * counit b`. -/
