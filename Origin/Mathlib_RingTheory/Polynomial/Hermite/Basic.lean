# Hermite polynomials

This file defines `Polynomial.hermite n`, the `n`th probabilists' Hermite polynomial.

## Main definitions

* `Polynomial.hermite n`: the `n`th probabilists' Hermite polynomial,
  defined recursively as a `Polynomial ℤ`

## Results

* `Polynomial.hermite_succ`: the recursion `hermite (n+1) = (x - d/dx) (hermite n)`
* `Polynomial.coeff_hermite_explicit`: a closed formula for (nonvanishing) coefficients in terms
  of binomial coefficients and double factorials.
* `Polynomial.coeff_hermite_of_odd_add`: for `n`,`k` where `n+k` is odd, `(hermite n).coeff k` is
  zero.
* `Polynomial.coeff_hermite_of_even_add`: a closed formula for `(hermite n).coeff k` when `n+k` is
  even, equivalent to `Polynomial.coeff_hermite_explicit`.
* `Polynomial.monic_hermite`: for all `n`, `hermite n` is monic.
* `Polynomial.degree_hermite`: for all `n`, `hermite n` has degree `n`.
