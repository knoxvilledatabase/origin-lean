# Resultant of two polynomials

This file contains basic facts about resultant of two polynomials over commutative rings.

## Main definitions

* `Polynomial.resultant`: The resultant of two polynomials `p` and `q` is defined as the determinant
  of the Sylvester matrix of `p` and `q`.
* `Polynomial.discr`: The discriminant of a polynomial `f` is defined as the resultant of `f` and
  `f.derivative`, modified by factoring out a sign and a power of the leading term.

## TODO

* The eventual goal is to prove the following property:
  `resultant (∏ a ∈ s, (X - C a)) f = ∏ a ∈ s, f.eval a`.
  This allows us to write the `resultant f g` as the product of terms of the form `a - b` where `a`
  is a root of `f` and `b` is a root of `g`.
* A smaller intermediate goal is to show that the Sylvester matrix corresponds to the linear map
  that we will call the Sylvester map, which is `R[X]_n × R[X]_m →ₗ[R] R[X]_(n + m)` given by
  `(p, q) ↦ f * p + g * q`, where `R[X]_n` is
  `Polynomial.degreeLT` in `Mathlib.RingTheory.Polynomial.Basic`.
* Resultant of two binary forms (i.e. homogeneous polynomials in two variables), after binary forms
  are implemented.
