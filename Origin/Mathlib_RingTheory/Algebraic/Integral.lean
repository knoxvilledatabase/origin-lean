# Algebraic elements and integral elements

This file relates algebraic and integral elements of an algebra, by proving every integral element
is algebraic and that every algebraic element over a field is integral.

## Main results

* `IsIntegral.isAlgebraic`, `Algebra.IsIntegral.isAlgebraic`: integral implies algebraic.
* `isAlgebraic_iff_isIntegral`, `Algebra.isAlgebraic_iff_isIntegral`: integral iff algebraic
  over a field.
* `IsAlgebraic.of_finite`, `Algebra.IsAlgebraic.of_finite`: finite-dimensional (as module) implies
  algebraic.
* `IsAlgebraic.exists_integral_multiple`: an algebraic element has a multiple which is integral
* `IsAlgebraic.iff_exists_smul_integral`: If `R` is reduced and `S` is an `R`-algebra with
  injective `algebraMap`, then an element of `S` is algebraic over `R` iff some `R`-multiple
  is integral over `R`.
* `Algebra.IsAlgebraic.trans`: If `A/S/R` is a tower of algebras and both `A/S` and `S/R` are
  algebraic, then `A/R` is also algebraic, provided that `S` has no zero divisors.
* `Subalgebra.algebraicClosure`: If `R` is a domain and `S` is an arbitrary `R`-algebra,
  then the elements of `S` that are algebraic over `R` form a subalgebra.
* `Transcendental.extendScalars`: an element of an `R`-algebra that is transcendental over `R`
  remains transcendental over any algebraic `R`-subalgebra that has no zero divisors.
