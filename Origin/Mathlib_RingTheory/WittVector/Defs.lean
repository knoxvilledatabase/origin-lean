# Witt vectors

In this file we define the type of `p`-typical Witt vectors and ring operations on it.
The ring axioms are verified in `Mathlib/RingTheory/WittVector/Basic.lean`.

For a fixed commutative ring `R` and prime `p`,
a Witt vector `x : 𝕎 R` is an infinite sequence `ℕ → R` of elements of `R`.
However, the ring operations `+` and `*` are not defined in the obvious component-wise way.
Instead, these operations are defined via certain polynomials
using the machinery in `Mathlib/RingTheory/WittVector/StructurePolynomial.lean`.
The `n`th value of the sum of two Witt vectors can depend on the `0`-th through `n`th values
of the summands. This effectively simulates a “carrying” operation.

## Main definitions

* `WittVector p R`: the type of `p`-typical Witt vectors with coefficients in `R`.
* `WittVector.coeff x n`: projects the `n`th value of the Witt vector `x`.

## Notation

We use notation `𝕎 R`, entered `\bbW`, for the Witt vectors over `R`.

structure WittVector (p : ℕ) (R : Type*) where mk' ::
  /-- `x.coeff n` is the `n`th coefficient of the Witt vector `x`.

  This concept does not have a standard name in the literature.
