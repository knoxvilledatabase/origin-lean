# `init` and `tail`

Given a Witt vector `x`, we are sometimes interested
in its components before and after an index `n`.
This file defines those operations, proves that `init` is polynomial,
and shows how that polynomial interacts with `MvPolynomial.bind₁`.

## Main declarations

* `WittVector.init n x`: the first `n` coefficients of `x`, as a Witt vector. All coefficients at
  indices ≥ `n` are 0.
* `WittVector.tail n x`: the complementary part to `init`. All coefficients at indices < `n` are 0,
  otherwise they are the same as in `x`.
* `WittVector.coeff_add_of_disjoint`: if `x` and `y` are Witt vectors such that for every `n`
  the `n`-th coefficient of `x` or of `y` is `0`, then the coefficients of `x + y`
  are just `x.coeff n + y.coeff n`.
