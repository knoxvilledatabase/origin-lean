# Without loss of generality tactic

The tactic `wlog h : P` will add an assumption `h : P` to the main goal,
and add a new goal that requires showing that the case `h : ¬ P` can be reduced to the case
where `P` holds (typically by symmetry).

The new goal will be placed at the top of the goal stack.
