# Every NonPreadditiveAbelian category is preadditive

In mathlib, we define an abelian category as a preadditive category with finite products,
kernels and cokernels, and in which every monomorphism and epimorphism is normal.

While virtually every interesting abelian category has a natural preadditive structure (which is why
it is included in the definition), preadditivity is not actually needed: Every category that has
all of the other properties appearing in the definition of an abelian category admits a preadditive
structure. This is the construction we carry out in this file.

The proof proceeds in roughly five steps:
1. Prove some results (for example that all equalizers exist) that would be trivial if we already
   had the preadditive structure but are a bit of work without it.
2. Develop images and coimages to show that every monomorphism is the kernel of its cokernel.

The results of the first two steps are also useful for the "normal" development of abelian
categories, and will be used there.

3. For every object `A`, define a "subtraction" morphism `σ : A ⨯ A ⟶ A` and use it to define
   subtraction on morphisms as `f - g := prod.lift f g ≫ σ`.
4. Prove a small number of identities about this subtraction from the definition of `σ`.
5. From these identities, prove a large number of other identities that imply that defining
   `f + g := f - (0 - g)` indeed gives an abelian group structure on morphisms such that composition
   is bilinear.

The construction is non-trivial and it is quite remarkable that this abelian group structure can
be constructed purely from the existence of a few limits and colimits. Even more remarkably,
since abelian categories admit exactly one preadditive structure (see
`subsingleton_preadditive_of_hasBinaryBiproducts`), the construction manages to exactly
reconstruct any natural preadditive structure the category may have.
