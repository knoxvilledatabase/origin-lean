# Pseudoelements in abelian categories

A *pseudoelement* of an object `X` in an abelian category `C` is an equivalence class of arrows
ending in `X`, where two arrows are considered equivalent if we can find two epimorphisms with a
common domain making a commutative square with the two arrows. While the construction shows that
pseudoelements are actually subobjects of `X` rather than "elements", it is possible to chase these
pseudoelements through commutative diagrams in an abelian category to prove exactness properties.
This is done using some "diagram-chasing metatheorems" proved in this file. In many cases, a proof
in the category of abelian groups can more or less directly be converted into a proof using
pseudoelements.

A classic application of pseudoelements is diagram lemmas like the four lemma or the snake lemma.

Pseudoelements are in some ways weaker than actual elements in a concrete category. The most
important limitation is that there is no extensionality principle: If `f g : X ⟶ Y`, then
`∀ x ∈ X, f x = g x` does not necessarily imply that `f = g` (however, if `f = 0` or `g = 0`,
it does). A corollary of this is that we cannot define arrows in abelian categories by dictating
their action on pseudoelements. Thus, a usual style of proofs in abelian categories is this:
First, we construct some morphism using universal properties, and then we use diagram chasing
of pseudoelements to verify that it has some desirable property such as exactness.

It should be noted that the Freyd-Mitchell embedding theorem
(see `CategoryTheory.Abelian.FreydMitchell`) gives a vastly stronger notion of
pseudoelement (in particular one that gives extensionality) and this file should be updated to
go use that instead!

## Main results

We define the type of pseudoelements of an object and, in particular, the zero pseudoelement.

We prove that every morphism maps the zero pseudoelement to the zero pseudoelement (`apply_zero`)
and that a zero morphism maps every pseudoelement to the zero pseudoelement (`zero_apply`).

Here are the metatheorems we provide:
* A morphism `f` is zero if and only if it is the zero function on pseudoelements.
* A morphism `f` is an epimorphism if and only if it is surjective on pseudoelements.
* A morphism `f` is a monomorphism if and only if it is injective on pseudoelements
  if and only if `∀ a, f a = 0 → f = 0`.
* A sequence `f, g` of morphisms is exact if and only if
  `∀ a, g (f a) = 0` and `∀ b, g b = 0 → ∃ a, f a = b`.
* If `f` is a morphism and `a, a'` are such that `f a = f a'`, then there is some
  pseudoelement `a''` such that `f a'' = 0` and for every `g` we have
  `g a' = 0 → g a = g a''`. We can think of `a''` as `a - a'`, but don't get too carried away
  by that: pseudoelements of an object do not form an abelian group.

## Notation

We introduce coercions from an object of an abelian category to the set of its pseudoelements
and from a morphism to the function it induces on pseudoelements.

These coercions must be explicitly enabled via local instances:
`attribute [local instance] objectToSort homToFun`

## Implementation notes

It appears that sometimes the coercion from morphisms to functions does not work, i.e.,
writing `g a` raises a "function expected" error. This error can be fixed by writing
`(g : X ⟶ Y) a`.
