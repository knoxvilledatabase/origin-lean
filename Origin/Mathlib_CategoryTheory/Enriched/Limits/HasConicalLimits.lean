# Existence of conical limits

This file contains different statements about the (non-constructive) existence of conical limits.

The main constructions are the following.

- `HasConicalLimit`: there exists a conical limit for `F : J ⥤ C`.
- `HasConicalLimitsOfShape J`: All functors `F : J ⥤ C` have conical limits.
- `HasConicalLimitsOfSize.{v₁, u₁}`: For all small `J` all functors `F : J ⥤ C` have conical limits.
- `HasConicalLimits`: `C` has all (small) conical limits.

## Implementation notes

`V` has been made an `(V : outParam <| Type u')` in the classes below as it seems instance
inference prefers this. Otherwise it failed with
`cannot find synthesization order` on the instances below.
However, it is not fully clear yet whether this could lead to potential issues, for example
if there are multiple `MonoidalCategory _` instances in scope.
