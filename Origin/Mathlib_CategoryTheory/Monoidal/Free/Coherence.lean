# The monoidal coherence theorem

In this file, we prove the monoidal coherence theorem, stated in the following form: the free
monoidal category over any type `C` is thin.

We follow a proof described by Ilya Beylin and Peter Dybjer, which has been previously formalized
in the proof assistant ALF. The idea is to declare a normal form (with regard to association and
adding units) on objects of the free monoidal category and consider the discrete subcategory of
objects that are in normal form. A normalization procedure is then just a functor
`fullNormalize : FreeMonoidalCategory C ⥤ Discrete (NormalMonoidalObject C)`, where
functoriality says that two objects which are related by associators and unitors have the
same normal form. Another desirable property of a normalization procedure is that an object is
isomorphic (i.e., related via associators and unitors) to its normal form. In the case of the
specific normalization procedure we use we not only get these isomorphisms, but also that they
assemble into a natural isomorphism `𝟭 (FreeMonoidalCategory C) ≅ fullNormalize ⋙ inclusion`.
But this means that any two parallel morphisms in the free monoidal category factor through a
discrete category in the same way, so they must be equal, and hence the free monoidal category
is thin.
