# Mayer-Vietoris squares

The purpose of this file is to allow the formalization of long exact
Mayer-Vietoris sequences in sheaf cohomology. If `X₄` is an open subset
of a topological space that is covered by two open subsets `X₂` and `X₃`,
it is known that there is a long exact sequence
`... ⟶ H^q(X₄) ⟶ H^q(X₂) ⊞ H^q(X₃) ⟶ H^q(X₁) ⟶ H^{q+1}(X₄) ⟶ ...`
where `X₁` is the intersection of `X₂` and `X₃`, and `H^q` are the
cohomology groups with values in an abelian sheaf.

In this file, we introduce a structure
`GrothendieckTopology.MayerVietorisSquare` which extends `Square C`,
and asserts properties which shall imply the existence of long
exact Mayer-Vietoris sequences in sheaf cohomology (TODO).
We require that the map `X₁ ⟶ X₃` is a monomorphism and
that the square in `C` becomes a pushout square in
the category of sheaves after the application of the
functor `yoneda ⋙ presheafToSheaf J _`. Note that in the
standard case of a covering by two open subsets, all
the morphisms in the square would be monomorphisms,
but this dissymmetry allows the example of Nisnevich distinguished
squares in the case of the Nisnevich topology on schemes (in which case
`f₂₄ : X₂ ⟶ X₄` shall be an open immersion and
`f₃₄ : X₃ ⟶ X₄` an étale map that is an isomorphism over
the closed (reduced) subscheme `X₄ - X₂`,
and `X₁` shall be the pullback of `f₂₄` and `f₃₄`.).

Given a Mayer-Vietoris square `S` and a presheaf `P` on `C`,
we introduce a sheaf condition `S.SheafCondition P` and show
that it is indeed satisfied by sheaves.
