# p-adic norm

This file defines the `p`-adic norm on `ℚ`.

The `p`-adic valuation on `ℚ` is the difference of the multiplicities of `p` in the numerator and
denominator of `q`. This function obeys the standard properties of a valuation, with the appropriate
assumptions on `p`.

The valuation induces a norm on `ℚ`. This norm is a nonarchimedean absolute value.
It takes values in {0} ∪ {1/p^k | k ∈ ℤ}.

## Implementation notes

Much, but not all, of this file assumes that `p` is prime. This assumption is inferred automatically
by taking `[Fact p.Prime]` as a type class argument.
