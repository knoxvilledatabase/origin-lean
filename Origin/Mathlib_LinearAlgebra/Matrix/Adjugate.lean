# Cramer's rule and adjugate matrices

The adjugate matrix is the transpose of the cofactor matrix.
It is calculated with Cramer's rule, which we introduce first.
The vectors returned by Cramer's rule are given by the linear map `cramer`,
which sends a matrix `A` and vector `b` to the vector consisting of the
determinant of replacing the `i`th column of `A` with `b` at index `i`
(written as `(A.updateCol i b).det`).
Using Cramer's rule, we can compute for each matrix `A` the matrix `adjugate A`.
The entries of the adjugate are the minors of `A`.
Instead of defining a minor by deleting row `i` and column `j` of `A`, we
replace the `i`th row of `A` with the `j`th basis vector; the resulting matrix
has the same determinant but more importantly equals Cramer's rule applied
to `A` and the `j`th basis vector, simplifying the subsequent proofs.
We prove the adjugate behaves like `det A • A⁻¹`.

## Main definitions

* `Matrix.cramer A b`: the vector output by Cramer's rule on `A` and `b`.
* `Matrix.adjugate A`: the adjugate (or classical adjoint) of the matrix `A`.

  ### `cramer` section

  Introduce the linear map `cramer` with values defined by `cramerMap`.
  After defining `cramerMap` and showing it is linear,
  we will restrict our proofs to using `cramer`.
