# Bases

This file defines bases in a module or vector space.

It is inspired by Isabelle/HOL's linear algebra, and hence indirectly by HOL Light.

## Main definitions

All definitions are given for families of vectors, i.e. `v : ι → M` where `M` is the module or
vector space and `ι : Type*` is an arbitrary indexing type.

* `Basis ι R M` is the type of `ι`-indexed `R`-bases for a module `M`,
  represented by a linear equiv `M ≃ₗ[R] ι →₀ R`.
* the basis vectors of a basis `b : Basis ι R M` are available as `b i`, where `i : ι`

* `Basis.repr` is the isomorphism sending `x : M` to its coordinates `Basis.repr x : ι →₀ R`.
  The converse, turning this isomorphism into a basis, is called `Basis.ofRepr`.
* If `ι` is finite, there is a variant of `repr` called `Basis.equivFun b : M ≃ₗ[R] ι → R`
  (saving you from having to work with `Finsupp`). The converse, turning this isomorphism into
  a basis, is called `Basis.ofEquivFun`.

* `Basis.reindex` uses an equiv to map a basis to a different indexing set.

* `Basis.map` uses a linear equiv to map a basis to a different module.

* `Basis.constr`: given `b : Basis ι R M` and `f : ι → M`, construct a linear map `g` so that
  `g (b i) = f i`.

* `Basis.coord`: `b.coord i x` is the `i`-th coordinate of a vector `x` with respect to the basis
  `b`.

## Main results

* `Basis.ext` states that two linear maps are equal if they coincide on a basis.
  Similar results are available for linear equivs (if they coincide on the basis vectors),
  elements (if their coordinates coincide) and the functions `b.repr` and `⇑b`.

## Implementation notes

We use families instead of sets because it allows us to say that two identical vectors are linearly
dependent. For bases, this is useful as well because we can easily derive ordered bases by using an
ordered index type `ι`.
