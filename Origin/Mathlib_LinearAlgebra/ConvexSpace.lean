# Convex spaces

This file defines convex spaces as an algebraic structure supporting finite convex combinations.

## Main definitions

* `StdSimplex R M`: A finitely supported probability distribution over elements of `M` with
  coefficients in `R`. The weights are non-negative and sum to 1.
* `StdSimplex.map`: Map a function over the support of a standard simplex.
* `StdSimplex.join`: Monadic join operation for standard simplices.
* `ConvexSpace R M`: A typeclass for spaces `M` equipped with an operation
  `convexCombination : StdSimplex R M → M` satisfying monadic laws.
* `convexComboPair`: Binary convex combinations of two points.

## Design

The design follows a monadic structure where `StdSimplex R` forms a monad and `convexCombination`
is a monadic algebra. This eliminates the need for explicit extensionality axioms and resolves
universe issues with indexed families.

## TODO

* Show that an `AffineSpace` is a `ConvexSpace`.
* Show that `lineMap` agrees with `convexComboPair` where defined.
* Show the usual associativity law for binary convex combinations follows from the `assoc` axiom.
