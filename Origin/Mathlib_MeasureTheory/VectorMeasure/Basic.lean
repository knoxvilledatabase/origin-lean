# Vector-valued measures

This file defines vector-valued measures, which are σ-additive functions from a set to an
additive monoid `M` such that it maps the empty set and non-measurable sets to zero. In the case
that `M = ℝ`, we called the vector measure a signed measure and write `SignedMeasure α`.
Similarly, when `M = ℂ`, we call the measure a complex measure and write `ComplexMeasure α`
(defined in `MeasureTheory/Measure/Complex`).

## Main definitions

* `MeasureTheory.VectorMeasure` is a vector-valued, σ-additive function that maps the empty
  and non-measurable sets to zero.
* `MeasureTheory.VectorMeasure.map` is the pushforward of a vector measure along a function.
* `MeasureTheory.VectorMeasure.restrict` is the restriction of a vector measure on some set.

## Notation

* `v ≤[i] w` means that the vector measure `v` restricted on the set `i` is less than or equal
  to the vector measure `w` restricted on `i`, i.e. `v.restrict i ≤ w.restrict i`.

## Implementation notes

We require all non-measurable sets to be mapped to zero in order for the extensionality lemma
to only compare the underlying functions for measurable sets.

We use `HasSum` instead of `tsum` in the definition of vector measures in comparison to `Measure`
since this provides summability.
