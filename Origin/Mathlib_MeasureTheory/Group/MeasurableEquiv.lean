# (Scalar) multiplication and (vector) addition as measurable equivalences

In this file we define the following measurable equivalences:

* `MeasurableEquiv.smul`: if a group `G` acts on `α` by measurable maps, then each element `c : G`
  defines a measurable automorphism of `α`;
* `MeasurableEquiv.vadd`: additive version of `MeasurableEquiv.smul`;
* `MeasurableEquiv.smul₀`: if a group with zero `G` acts on `α` by measurable maps, then each
  nonzero element `c : G` defines a measurable automorphism of `α`;
* `MeasurableEquiv.mulLeft`: if `G` is a group with measurable multiplication, then left
  multiplication by `g : G` is a measurable automorphism of `G`;
* `MeasurableEquiv.addLeft`: additive version of `MeasurableEquiv.mulLeft`;
* `MeasurableEquiv.mulRight`: if `G` is a group with measurable multiplication, then right
  multiplication by `g : G` is a measurable automorphism of `G`;
* `MeasurableEquiv.addRight`: additive version of `MeasurableEquiv.mulRight`;
* `MeasurableEquiv.mulLeft₀`, `MeasurableEquiv.mulRight₀`: versions of
  `MeasurableEquiv.mulLeft` and `MeasurableEquiv.mulRight` for groups with zero;
* `MeasurableEquiv.inv`: `Inv.inv` as a measurable automorphism
  of a group (or a group with zero);
* `MeasurableEquiv.neg`: negation as a measurable automorphism of an additive group.

We also deduce that the corresponding maps are measurable embeddings.
