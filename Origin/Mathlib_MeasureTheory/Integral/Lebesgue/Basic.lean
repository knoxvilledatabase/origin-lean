# Lower Lebesgue integral for `ℝ≥0∞`-valued functions

We define the lower Lebesgue integral of an `ℝ≥0∞`-valued function.

## Notation

We introduce the following notation for the lower Lebesgue integral of a function `f : α → ℝ≥0∞`.

* `∫⁻ x, f x ∂μ`: integral of a function `f : α → ℝ≥0∞` with respect to a measure `μ`;
* `∫⁻ x, f x`: integral of a function `f : α → ℝ≥0∞` with respect to the canonical measure
  `volume` on `α`;
* `∫⁻ x in s, f x ∂μ`: integral of a function `f : α → ℝ≥0∞` over a set `s` with respect
  to a measure `μ`, defined as `∫⁻ x, f x ∂(μ.restrict s)`;
* `∫⁻ x in s, f x`: integral of a function `f : α → ℝ≥0∞` over a set `s` with respect
  to the canonical measure `volume`, defined as `∫⁻ x, f x ∂(volume.restrict s)`.

/-! In the notation for integrals, an expression like `∫⁻ x, g ‖x‖ ∂μ` will not be parsed correctly,
  and needs parentheses. We do not set the binding power of `r` to `0`, because then
  `∫⁻ x, f x = 0` will be parsed incorrectly. -/
