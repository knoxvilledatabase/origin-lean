# Contents

In this file we work with *contents*. A content `λ` is a function from a certain class of subsets
(such as the compact subsets) to `ℝ≥0` that is
* additive: If `K₁` and `K₂` are disjoint sets in the domain of `λ`,
  then `λ(K₁ ∪ K₂) = λ(K₁) + λ(K₂)`;
* subadditive: If `K₁` and `K₂` are in the domain of `λ`, then `λ(K₁ ∪ K₂) ≤ λ(K₁) + λ(K₂)`;
* monotone: If `K₁ ⊆ K₂` are in the domain of `λ`, then `λ(K₁) ≤ λ(K₂)`.

We show that:
* Given a content `λ` on compact sets, let us define a function `λ*` on open sets, by letting
  `λ* U` be the supremum of `λ K` for `K` included in `U`. This is a countably subadditive map that
  vanishes at `∅`. In Halmos (1950) this is called the *inner content* `λ*` of `λ`, and formalized
  as `innerContent`.
* Given an inner content, we define an outer measure `μ*`, by letting `μ* E` be the infimum of
  `λ* U` over the open sets `U` containing `E`. This is indeed an outer measure. It is formalized
  as `outerMeasure`.
* Restricting this outer measure to Borel sets gives a regular measure `μ`.

We define bundled contents as `Content`.
In this file we only work on contents on compact sets, and inner contents on open sets, and both
contents and inner contents map into the extended nonnegative reals. However, in other applications
other choices can be made, and it is not a priori clear what the best interface should be.

## Main definitions

For `μ : Content G`, we define
* `μ.innerContent` : the inner content associated to `μ`.
* `μ.outerMeasure` : the outer measure associated to `μ`.
* `μ.measure`      : the Borel measure associated to `μ`.

These definitions are given for spaces which are R₁.
The resulting measure `μ.measure` is always outer regular by design.
When the space is locally compact, `μ.measure` is also regular.
