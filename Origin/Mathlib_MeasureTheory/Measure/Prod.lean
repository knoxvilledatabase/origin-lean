# The product measure

In this file we define and prove properties about the binary product measure. If `α` and `β` have
s-finite measures `μ` resp. `ν` then `α × β` can be equipped with an s-finite measure `μ.prod ν`
that satisfies `(μ.prod ν) s = ∫⁻ x, ν {y | (x, y) ∈ s} ∂μ`.
We also have `(μ.prod ν) (s ×ˢ t) = μ s * ν t`, i.e. the measure of a rectangle is the product of
the measures of the sides.

We also prove Tonelli's theorem.

## Main definition

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.prod`: The product of two measures.

## Main results

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.prod_apply` states `μ.prod ν s = ∫⁻ x, ν {y | (x, y) ∈ s} ∂μ`
  for measurable `s`. `MeasureTheory.Measure.prod_apply_symm` is the reversed version.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.prod_prod` states `μ.prod ν (s ×ˢ t) = μ s * ν t` for measurable sets
  `s` and `t`.
* `MeasureTheory.lintegral_prod`: Tonelli's theorem. It states that for a measurable function
  `α × β → ℝ≥0∞` we have `∫⁻ z, f z ∂(μ.prod ν) = ∫⁻ x, ∫⁻ y, f (x, y) ∂ν ∂μ`. The version
  for functions `α → β → ℝ≥0∞` is reversed, and called `lintegral_lintegral`. Both versions have
  a variant with `_symm` appended, where the order of integration is reversed.
  The lemma `Measurable.lintegral_prod_right'` states that the inner integral of the right-hand side
  is measurable.

## Implementation Notes

Many results are proven twice, once for functions in curried form (`α → β → γ`) and one for
functions in uncurried form (`α × β → γ`). The former often has an assumption
`Measurable (uncurry f)`, which could be inconvenient to discharge, but for the latter it is more
common that the function has to be given explicitly, since Lean cannot synthesize the function by
itself. We name the lemmas about the uncurried form with a prime.
Tonelli's theorem has a different naming scheme, since the version for the uncurried version is
reversed.
