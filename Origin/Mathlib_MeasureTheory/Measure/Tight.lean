# Tight sets of measures

A set of measures is tight if for all `0 < ε`, there exists a compact set `K` such that for all
measures in the set, the complement of `K` has measure at most `ε`.

## Main definitions

* `MeasureTheory.IsTightMeasureSet`: A set of measures `S` is tight if for all `0 < ε`, there exists
  a compact set `K` such that for all `μ ∈ S`, `μ Kᶜ ≤ ε`.
  The definition uses an equivalent formulation with filters: `⨆ μ ∈ S, μ` tends to `0` along the
  filter of cocompact sets.
  `isTightMeasureSet_iff_exists_isCompact_measure_compl_le` establishes equivalence between
  the two definitions.

## Main statements

* `isTightMeasureSet_singleton_of_innerRegularWRT`: every finite, inner-regular measure is tight.
* `isTightMeasureSet_of_isCompact_closure`: every relatively compact set of measures is tight.
