# Complex measure

This file defines a complex measure to be a vector measure with codomain `ℂ`.
Then we prove some elementary results about complex measures. In particular, we prove that
a complex measure is always in the form `s + it` where `s` and `t` are signed measures.

## Main definitions

* `MeasureTheory.ComplexMeasure.re`: obtains a signed measure `s` from a complex measure `c`
  such that `s i = (c i).re` for all measurable sets `i`.
* `MeasureTheory.ComplexMeasure.im`: obtains a signed measure `s` from a complex measure `c`
  such that `s i = (c i).im` for all measurable sets `i`.
* `MeasureTheory.SignedMeasure.toComplexMeasure`: given two signed measures `s` and `t`,
  `s.toComplexMeasure t` provides a complex measure of the form `s + it`.
* `MeasureTheory.ComplexMeasure.equivSignedMeasure`: is the equivalence between the complex
  measures and the type of the product of the signed measures with itself.
