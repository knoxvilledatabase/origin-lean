# Sylow theorems

The Sylow theorems are the following results for every finite group `G` and every prime number `p`.

* There exists a Sylow `p`-subgroup of `G`.
* All Sylow `p`-subgroups of `G` are conjugate to each other.
* Let `nₚ` be the number of Sylow `p`-subgroups of `G`, then `nₚ` divides the index of the Sylow
  `p`-subgroup, `nₚ ≡ 1 [MOD p]`, and `nₚ` is equal to the index of the normalizer of the Sylow
  `p`-subgroup in `G`.

## Main definitions

* `Sylow p G` : The type of Sylow `p`-subgroups of `G`.

## Main statements

* `Sylow.exists_subgroup_card_pow_prime`: A generalization of Sylow's first theorem:
  For every prime power `pⁿ` dividing the cardinality of `G`,
  there exists a subgroup of `G` of order `pⁿ`.
* `IsPGroup.exists_le_sylow`: A generalization of Sylow's first theorem:
  Every `p`-subgroup is contained in a Sylow `p`-subgroup.
* `Sylow.card_eq_multiplicity`: The cardinality of a Sylow subgroup is `p ^ n`
  where `n` is the multiplicity of `p` in the group order.
* `Sylow.isPretransitive_of_finite`: a generalization of Sylow's second theorem:
  If the number of Sylow `p`-subgroups is finite, then all Sylow `p`-subgroups are conjugate.
* `card_sylow_modEq_one`: a generalization of Sylow's third theorem:
  If the number of Sylow `p`-subgroups is finite, then it is congruent to `1` modulo `p`.
