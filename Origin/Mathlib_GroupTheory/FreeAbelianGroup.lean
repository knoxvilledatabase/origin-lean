# Free abelian groups

The free abelian group on a type `α`, defined as the abelianisation of
the free group on `α`.

The free abelian group on `α` can be abstractly defined as the left adjoint of the
forgetful functor from abelian groups to types. Alternatively, one could define
it as the functions `α → ℤ` which send all but finitely many `(a : α)` to `0`,
under pointwise addition. In this file, it is defined as the abelianisation
of the free group on `α`. All the constructions and theorems required to show
the adjointness of the construction and the forgetful functor are proved in this
file, but the category-theoretic adjunction statement is in
`Mathlib/Algebra/Category/Grp/Adjunctions.lean`.

## Main definitions

Here we use the following variables: `(α β : Type*) (A : Type*) [AddCommGroup A]`

* `FreeAbelianGroup α` : the free abelian group on a type `α`. As an abelian
  group it is `α →₀ ℤ`, the functions from `α` to `ℤ` such that all but finitely
  many elements get mapped to zero, however this is not how it is implemented.

* `lift f : FreeAbelianGroup α →+ A` : the group homomorphism induced
  by the map `f : α → A`.

* `map (f : α → β) : FreeAbelianGroup α →+ FreeAbelianGroup β` : functoriality
    of `FreeAbelianGroup`.

* `instance [Monoid α] : Semigroup (FreeAbelianGroup α)`

* `instance [CommMonoid α] : CommRing (FreeAbelianGroup α)`

It has been suggested that we would be better off refactoring this file
and using `Finsupp` instead.

## Implementation issues

The definition is `def FreeAbelianGroup : Type u := Additive <| Abelianization <| FreeGroup α`.

Chris Hughes has suggested that this all be rewritten in terms of `Finsupp`.
Johan Commelin has written all the API relating the definition to `Finsupp`
in the lean-liquid repo.

The lemmas `map_pure`, `map_of`, `map_zero`, `map_add`, `map_neg` and `map_sub`
are proved about the `Functor.map` `<$>` construction, and need `α` and `β` to
be in the same universe. But
`FreeAbelianGroup.map (f : α → β)` is defined to be the `AddGroup`
homomorphism `FreeAbelianGroup α →+ FreeAbelianGroup β` (with `α` and `β` now
allowed to be in different universes), so `(map f).map_add`
etc. can be used to prove that `FreeAbelianGroup.map` preserves addition. The
functions `map_id`, `map_id_apply`, `map_comp`, `map_comp_apply` and `map_of_apply`
are about `FreeAbelianGroup.map`.
