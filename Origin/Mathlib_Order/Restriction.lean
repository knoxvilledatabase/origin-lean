# Restriction of a function indexed by a preorder

Given a preorder `α` and dependent function `f : (i : α) → π i` and `a : α`, one might want
to consider the restriction of `f` to elements `≤ a`.
This is defined in this file as `Preorder.restrictLe a f`.
Similarly, if we have `a b : α`, `hab : a ≤ b` and `f : (i : ↑(Set.Iic b)) → π ↑i`,
one might want to restrict it to elements `≤ a`.
This is defined in this file as `Preorder.restrictLe₂ hab f`.

We also provide versions where the intervals are seen as finite sets, see `Preorder.frestrictLe`
and `Preorder.frestrictLe₂`.

## Main definitions
* `Preorder.restrictLe a f`: Restricts the function `f` to the variables indexed by elements `≤ a`.
