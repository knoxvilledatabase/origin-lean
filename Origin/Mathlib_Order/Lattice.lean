# (Semi-)lattices

Semilattices are partially ordered sets with join (least upper bound, or `sup`) or meet (greatest
lower bound, or `inf`) operations. Lattices are posets that are both join-semilattices and
meet-semilattices.

Distributive lattices are lattices which satisfy any of four equivalent distributivity properties,
of `sup` over `inf`, on the left or on the right.

## Main declarations

* `SemilatticeSup`: a type class for join semilattices
* `SemilatticeSup.mk'`: an alternative constructor for `SemilatticeSup` via proofs that `⊔` is
  commutative, associative and idempotent.
* `SemilatticeInf`: a type class for meet semilattices
* `SemilatticeSup.mk'`: an alternative constructor for `SemilatticeInf` via proofs that `⊓` is
  commutative, associative and idempotent.

* `Lattice`: a type class for lattices
* `Lattice.mk'`: an alternative constructor for `Lattice` via proofs that `⊔` and `⊓` are
  commutative, associative and satisfy a pair of "absorption laws".

* `DistribLattice`: a type class for distributive lattices.

## Notation

* `a ⊔ b`: the supremum or join of `a` and `b`
* `a ⊓ b`: the infimum or meet of `a` and `b`

## TODO

* (Semi-)lattice homomorphisms
* Alternative constructors for distributive lattices from the other distributive properties

### Join-semilattices

class SemilatticeSup (α : Type u) extends PartialOrder α where
  /-- The binary supremum, used to derive `Max α` -/
  sup : α → α → α
  /-- The supremum is an upper bound on the first argument -/
  protected le_sup_left : ∀ a b : α, a ≤ sup a b
  /-- The supremum is an upper bound on the second argument -/
  protected le_sup_right : ∀ a b : α, b ≤ sup a b
  /-- The supremum is the *least* upper bound -/
  protected sup_le : ∀ a b c : α, a ≤ c → b ≤ c → sup a b ≤ c
