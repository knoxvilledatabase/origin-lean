# Game addition relation

This file defines, given relations `rα : α → α → Prop` and `rβ : β → β → Prop`, a relation
`Prod.GameAdd` on pairs, such that `GameAdd rα rβ x y` iff `x` can be reached from `y` by
decreasing either entry (with respect to `rα` and `rβ`). It is so called since it models the
subsequency relation on the addition of combinatorial games.

We also define `Sym2.GameAdd`, which is the unordered pair analog of `Prod.GameAdd`.

## Main definitions and results

- `Prod.GameAdd`: the game addition relation on ordered pairs.
- `WellFounded.prod_gameAdd`: formalizes induction on ordered pairs, where exactly one entry
  decreases at a time.

- `Sym2.GameAdd`: the game addition relation on unordered pairs.
- `WellFounded.sym2_gameAdd`: formalizes induction on unordered pairs, where exactly one entry
  decreases at a time.
