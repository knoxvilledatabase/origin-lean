# Filters with countable intersection property

In this file we define `CountableInterFilter` to be the class of filters with the following
property: for any countable collection of sets `s ∈ l` their intersection belongs to `l` as well.

Two main examples are the `residual` filter defined in `Mathlib/Topology/GDelta/Basic.lean` and
the `MeasureTheory.ae` filter defined in `Mathlib/MeasureTheory/OuterMeasure/AE.lean`.

We reformulate the definition in terms of indexed intersection and in terms of `Filter.Eventually`
and provide instances for some basic constructions (`⊥`, `⊤`, `Filter.principal`, `Filter.map`,
`Filter.comap`, `Inf.inf`). We also provide a custom constructor `Filter.ofCountableInter`
that deduces two axioms of a `Filter` from the countable intersection property.

Note that there also exists a typeclass `CardinalInterFilter`, and thus an alternative spelling of
`CountableInterFilter` as `CardinalInterFilter l ℵ₁`. The former (defined here) is the
preferred spelling; it has the advantage of not requiring the user to import the theory of ordinals.
