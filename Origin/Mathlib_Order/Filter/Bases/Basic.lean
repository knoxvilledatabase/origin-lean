# Basic results on filter bases

A filter basis `B : FilterBasis α` on a type `α` is a nonempty collection of sets of `α`
such that the intersection of two elements of this collection contains some element of
the collection. Compared to filters, filter bases do not require that any set containing
an element of `B` belongs to `B`.
A filter basis `B` can be used to construct `B.filter : Filter α` such that a set belongs
to `B.filter` if and only if it contains an element of `B`.

Given an indexing type `ι`, a predicate `p : ι → Prop`, and a map `s : ι → Set α`,
the proposition `h : Filter.IsBasis p s` makes sure the range of `s` bounded by `p`
(i.e. `s '' setOf p`) defines a filter basis `h.filterBasis`.

If one already has a filter `l` on `α`, `Filter.HasBasis l p s` (where `p : ι → Prop`
and `s : ι → Set α` as above) means that a set belongs to `l` if and
only if it contains some `s i` with `p i`. It implies `h : Filter.IsBasis p s`, and
`l = h.filterBasis.filter`. The point of this definition is that checking statements
involving elements of `l` often reduces to checking them on the basis elements.

We define a function `HasBasis.index (h : Filter.HasBasis l p s) (t) (ht : t ∈ l)` that returns
some index `i` such that `p i` and `s i ⊆ t`. This function can be useful to avoid manual
destruction of `h.mem_iff.mpr ht` using `cases` or `let`.

## Main statements

* `Filter.HasBasis.mem_iff`, `HasBasis.mem_of_superset`, `HasBasis.mem_of_mem` : restate `t ∈ f` in
  terms of a basis;

* `Filter.HasBasis.le_iff`, `Filter.HasBasis.ge_iff`, `Filter.HasBasis.le_basis_iff` : restate
  `l ≤ l'` in terms of bases.

* `Filter.basis_sets` : all sets of a filter form a basis;

* `Filter.HasBasis.inf`, `Filter.HasBasis.inf_principal`, `Filter.HasBasis.prod`,
  `Filter.HasBasis.prod_self`, `Filter.HasBasis.map`, `Filter.HasBasis.comap` : combinators to
  construct filters of `l ⊓ l'`, `l ⊓ 𝓟 t`, `l ×ˢ l'`, `l ×ˢ l`, `l.map f`, `l.comap f`
  respectively;

* `Filter.HasBasis.tendsto_right_iff`, `Filter.HasBasis.tendsto_left_iff`,
  `Filter.HasBasis.tendsto_iff` : restate `Tendsto f l l'` in terms of bases.

## Implementation notes

As with `Set.iUnion`/`biUnion`/`Set.sUnion`, there are three different approaches to filter bases:

* `Filter.HasBasis l s`, `s : Set (Set α)`;
* `Filter.HasBasis l s`, `s : ι → Set α`;
* `Filter.HasBasis l p s`, `p : ι → Prop`, `s : ι → Set α`.

We use the latter one because, e.g., `𝓝 x` in an `EMetricSpace` or in a `MetricSpace` has a basis
of this form. The other two can be emulated using `s = id` or `p = fun _ ↦ True`.

With this approach sometimes one needs to `simp` the statement provided by the `Filter.HasBasis`
machinery, e.g., `simp only [true_and_iff]` or `simp only [forall_const]` can help with the case
`p = fun _ ↦ True`.
