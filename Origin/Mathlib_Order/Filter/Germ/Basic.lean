# Germ of a function at a filter

The germ of a function `f : α → β` at a filter `l : Filter α` is the equivalence class of `f`
with respect to the equivalence relation `EventuallyEq l`: `f ≈ g` means `∀ᶠ x in l, f x = g x`.

## Main definitions

We define

* `Filter.Germ l β` to be the space of germs of functions `α → β` at a filter `l : Filter α`;
* coercion from `α → β` to `Germ l β`: `(f : Germ l β)` is the germ of `f : α → β`
  at `l : Filter α`; this coercion is declared as `CoeTC`;
* `(const l c : Germ l β)` is the germ of the constant function `fun x : α ↦ c` at a filter `l`;
* coercion from `β` to `Germ l β`: `(↑c : Germ l β)` is the germ of the constant function
  `fun x : α ↦ c` at a filter `l`; this coercion is declared as `CoeTC`;
* `map (F : β → γ) (f : Germ l β)` to be the composition of a function `F` and a germ `f`;
* `map₂ (F : β → γ → δ) (f : Germ l β) (g : Germ l γ)` to be the germ of `fun x ↦ F (f x) (g x)`
  at `l`;
* `f.Tendsto lb`: we say that a germ `f : Germ l β` tends to a filter `lb` if its representatives
  tend to `lb` along `l`;
* `f.compTendsto g hg` and `f.compTendsto' g hg`: given `f : Germ l β` and a function
  `g : γ → α` (resp., a germ `g : Germ lc α`), if `g` tends to `l` along `lc`, then the composition
  `f ∘ g` is a well-defined germ at `lc`;
* `Germ.liftPred`, `Germ.liftRel`: lift a predicate or a relation to the space of germs:
  `(f : Germ l β).liftPred p` means `∀ᶠ x in l, p (f x)`, and similarly for a relation.

We also define `map (F : β → γ) : Germ l β → Germ l γ` sending each germ `f` to `F ∘ f`.

For each of the following structures we prove that if `β` has this structure, then so does
`Germ l β`:

* one-operation algebraic structures up to `CommGroup`;
* `MulZeroClass`, `Distrib`, `Semiring`, `CommSemiring`, `Ring`, `CommRing`;
* `MulAction`, `DistribMulAction`, `Module`;
* `Preorder`, `PartialOrder`, and `Lattice` structures, as well as `BoundedOrder`;
