# Definitions of conditionally complete lattices

A conditionally complete lattice is a lattice in which every non-empty bounded subset `s`
has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound, denoted below by `sSup s` and `sInf s`.
Typical examples are `ℝ`, `ℕ`, and `ℤ` with their usual orders.

The theory is very comparable to the theory of complete lattices, except that suitable
boundedness and nonemptiness assumptions have to be added to most statements.
We express these using the `BddAbove` and `BddBelow` predicates, which we use to prove
most useful properties of `sSup` and `sInf` in conditionally complete lattices.

To differentiate the statements between complete lattices and conditionally complete
lattices, we prefix `sInf` and `sSup` in the statements by `c`, giving `csInf` and `csSup`.
For instance, `sInf_le` is a statement in complete lattices ensuring `sInf s ≤ x`,
while `csInf_le` is the same statement in conditionally complete lattices
with an additional assumption that `s` is bounded below.
