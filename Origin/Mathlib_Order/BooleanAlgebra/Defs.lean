# (Generalized) Boolean algebras

This file sets up the theory of (generalized) Boolean algebras.

A Boolean algebra is a bounded distributive lattice with a complement operator. Boolean algebras
generalize the (classical) logic of propositions and the lattice of subsets of a set.

Generalized Boolean algebras may be less familiar, but they are essentially Boolean algebras which
do not necessarily have a top element (`⊤`) (and hence not all elements may have complements). One
example in mathlib is `Finset α`, the type of all finite subsets of an arbitrary
(not-necessarily-finite) type `α`.

`GeneralizedBooleanAlgebra α` is defined to be a distributive lattice with bottom (`⊥`) admitting
a *relative* complement operator, written using "set difference" notation as `x \ y` (`sdiff x y`).
For convenience, the `BooleanAlgebra` type class is defined to extend `GeneralizedBooleanAlgebra`
so that it is also bundled with a `\` operator.

(A terminological point: `x \ y` is the complement of `y` relative to the interval `[⊥, x]`. We do
not yet have relative complements for arbitrary intervals, as we do not even have lattice
intervals.)

## Main declarations

* `GeneralizedBooleanAlgebra`: a type class for generalized Boolean algebras
* `BooleanAlgebra`: a type class for Boolean algebras.
* `Prop.booleanAlgebra`: the Boolean algebra instance on `Prop`

## Implementation notes

The `sup_inf_sdiff` and `inf_inf_sdiff` axioms for the relative complement operator in
`GeneralizedBooleanAlgebra` are taken from
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra_(structure)#Generalizations).

[Stone's paper introducing generalized Boolean algebras][Stone1935] does not define a relative
complement operator `a \ b` for all `a`, `b`. Instead, the postulates there amount to an assumption
that for all `a, b : α` where `a ≤ b`, the equations `x ⊔ a = b` and `x ⊓ a = ⊥` have a solution
`x`. `Disjoint.sdiff_unique` proves that this `x` is in fact `b \ a`.
