# Complete Partial Orders

This file considers complete partial orders (sometimes called directedly complete partial orders).
These are partial orders for which every directed set has a least upper bound.

## Main declarations

- `CompletePartialOrder`: Typeclass for (directly) complete partial orders.

## Main statements

- `CompletePartialOrder.toOmegaCompletePartialOrder`: A complete partial order is an ω-complete
  partial order.
- `CompleteLattice.toCompletePartialOrder`: A complete lattice is a complete partial order.
