# Successor and predecessor

This file defines successor and predecessor orders. `succ a`, the successor of an element `a : α` is
the least element greater than `a`. `pred a` is the greatest element less than `a`. Typical examples
include `ℕ`, `ℤ`, `ℕ+`, `Fin n`, but also `ENat`, the lexicographic order of a successor/predecessor
order...

## Typeclasses

* `SuccOrder`: Order equipped with a sensible successor function.
* `PredOrder`: Order equipped with a sensible predecessor function.

## Implementation notes

Maximal elements don't have a sensible successor. Thus the naïve typeclass
```lean
class NaiveSuccOrder (α : Type*) [Preorder α] where
  (succ : α → α)
  (succ_le_iff : ∀ {a b}, succ a ≤ b ↔ a < b)
  (lt_succ_iff : ∀ {a b}, a < succ b ↔ a ≤ b)
```
can't apply to an `OrderTop` because plugging in `a = b = ⊤` into either of `succ_le_iff` and
`lt_succ_iff` yields `⊤ < ⊤` (or more generally `m < m` for a maximal element `m`).
The solution taken here is to remove the implications `≤ → <` and instead require that `a < succ a`
for all non-maximal elements (enforced by the combination of `le_succ` and the contrapositive of
`max_of_succ_le`).
The stricter condition of every element having a sensible successor can be obtained through the
combination of `SuccOrder α` and `NoMaxOrder α`.
