# Unitary elements of a star monoid

This file defines `unitary R`, where `R` is a star monoid, as the submonoid made of the elements
that satisfy `star U * U = 1` and `U * star U = 1`, and these form a group.
This includes, for instance, unitary operators on Hilbert spaces.

See also `Matrix.UnitaryGroup` for specializations to `unitary (Matrix n n R)`.
