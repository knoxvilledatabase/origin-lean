# Star monoids, rings, and modules

We introduce the basic algebraic notions of star monoids, star rings, and star modules.
A star algebra is simply a star ring that is also a star module.

These are implemented as "mixin" typeclasses, so to summon a star ring (for example)
one needs to write `(R : Type*) [Ring R] [StarRing R]`.
This avoids difficulties with diamond inheritance.

For now we simply do not introduce notations,
as different users are expected to feel strongly about the relative merits of
`r^*`, `r†`, `rᘁ`, and so on.

Our star rings are actually star non-unital, non-associative, semirings, but of course we can prove
`star_neg : star (-r) = - star r` when the underlying semiring is a ring.
