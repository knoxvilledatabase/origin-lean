# Homology of short complexes

In this file, we shall define the homology of short complexes `S`, i.e. diagrams
`f : X₁ ⟶ X₂` and `g : X₂ ⟶ X₃` such that `f ≫ g = 0`. We shall say that
`[S.HasHomology]` when there exists `h : S.HomologyData`. A homology data
for `S` consists of compatible left/right homology data `left` and `right`. The
left homology data `left` involves an object `left.H` that is a cokernel of the canonical
map `S.X₁ ⟶ K` where `K` is a kernel of `g`. On the other hand, the dual notion `right.H`
is a kernel of the canonical morphism `Q ⟶ S.X₃` when `Q` is a cokernel of `f`.
The compatibility that is required involves an isomorphism `left.H ≅ right.H` which
makes a certain pentagon commute. When such a homology data exists, `S.homology`
shall be defined as `h.left.H` for a chosen `h : S.HomologyData`.

This definition requires very little assumption on the category (only the existence
of zero morphisms). We shall prove that in abelian categories, all short complexes
have homology data.

Note: This definition arose by the end of the Liquid Tensor Experiment which
contained a structure `has_homology` which is quite similar to `S.HomologyData`.
After the category `ShortComplex C` was introduced by J. Riou, A. Topaz suggested
such a structure could be used as a basis for the *definition* of homology.
