# Complex shapes for pages of spectral sequences

In this file, we define complex shapes which correspond
to pages of spectral sequences:
* `ComplexShape.spectralSequenceNat`: for any `u : ℤ × ℤ`, this
is the complex shape on `ℕ × ℕ` corresponding to differentials
of `ComplexShape.up' u : ComplexShape (ℤ × ℤ)` with source
and target in `ℕ × ℕ`. (With `u := (r, 1 - r)`, this will
apply to the `r`th-page of first quadrant `E₂` cohomological
spectral sequence).
* `ComplexShape.spectralSequenceFin`: for any `u : ℤ × ℤ` and `l : ℕ`,
this is a similar definition as `ComplexShape.spectralSequenceNat`
but for `ℤ × Fin l` (identified as a subset of `ℤ × ℤ`). (This could
be used for spectral sequences associated to a *finite* filtration.)
