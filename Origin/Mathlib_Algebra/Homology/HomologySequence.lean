# The homology sequence

If `0 ⟶ X₁ ⟶ X₂ ⟶ X₃ ⟶ 0` is a short exact sequence in a category of complexes
`HomologicalComplex C c` in an abelian category (i.e. `S` is a short complex in
that category and satisfies `hS : S.ShortExact`), then whenever `i` and `j` are degrees
such that `hij : c.Rel i j`, then there is a long exact sequence :
`... ⟶ S.X₁.homology i ⟶ S.X₂.homology i ⟶ S.X₃.homology i ⟶ S.X₁.homology j ⟶ ...`.
The connecting homomorphism `S.X₃.homology i ⟶ S.X₁.homology j` is `hS.δ i j hij`, and
the exactness is asserted as lemmas `hS.homology_exact₁`, `hS.homology_exact₂` and
`hS.homology_exact₃`.

The proof is based on the snake lemma, similarly as it was originally done in
the Liquid Tensor Experiment.
