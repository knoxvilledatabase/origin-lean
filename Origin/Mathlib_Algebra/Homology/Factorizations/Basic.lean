# Basic definitions for factorization lemmas

We define the class of morphisms
`degreewiseEpiWithInjectiveKernel : MorphismProperty (CochainComplex C ℤ)`
in the category of cochain complexes in an abelian category `C`.

When restricted to the full subcategory of bounded below cochain complexes in an
abelian category `C` that has enough injectives, this is the class of
fibrations for a model category structure on the bounded below
category of cochain complexes in `C`. In this folder, we intend to prove two factorization
lemmas in the category of bounded below cochain complexes (TODO):
* CM5a: any morphism `K ⟶ L` can be factored as `K ⟶ K' ⟶ L` where `i : K ⟶ K'` is a
  trivial cofibration (a mono that is also a quasi-isomorphism) and `p : K' ⟶ L` is a fibration.
* CM5b: any morphism `K ⟶ L` can be factored as `K ⟶ L' ⟶ L` where `i : K ⟶ L'` is a
  cofibration (i.e. a mono) and `p : L' ⟶ L` is a trivial fibration (i.e. a quasi-isomorphism
  which is also a fibration)

The difficult part is CM5a (whose proof uses CM5b). These lemmas shall be essential
ingredients in the proof that the bounded below derived category of an abelian
category `C` with enough injectives identifies to the bounded below homotopy category
of complexes of injective objects in `C`. This will be used in the construction
of total derived functors (and a refactor of the sequence of derived functors).
