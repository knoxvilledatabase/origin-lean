# A list of coefficients of a polynomial

## Definition

* `coeffList f`: a `List` of the coefficients, from leading term down to constant term.
* `coeffList 0` is defined to be `[]`.

This is useful for talking about polynomials in terms of list operations. It is "redundant" data in
the sense that `Polynomial` is already a `Finsupp` (of its coefficients), and `Polynomial.coeff`
turns this into a function, and these have exactly the same data as `coeffList`. The difference is
that `coeffList` is intended for working together with list operations: getting `List.head`,
comparing adjacent coefficients with each other, or anything that involves induction on Polynomials
by dropping the leading term (which is `Polynomial.eraseLead`).

Note that `coeffList` _starts_ with the highest-degree terms and _ends_ with the constant term. This
might seem backwards in the sense that `Polynomial.coeff` and `List.get!` are reversed to one
another, but it means that induction on `List`s is the same as induction on
`Polynomial.leadingCoeff`.

The most significant theorem here is `coeffList_eraseLead`, which says that `coeffList P` can be
written as `leadingCoeff P :: List.replicate k 0 ++ coeffList P.eraseLead`. That is, the list
of coefficients starts with the leading coefficient, followed by some number of zeros, and then the
coefficients of `P.eraseLead`.
