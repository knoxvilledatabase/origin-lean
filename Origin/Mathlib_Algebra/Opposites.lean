# Multiplicative opposite and algebraic operations on it

In this file we define `MulOpposite α = αᵐᵒᵖ` to be the multiplicative opposite of `α`. It inherits
all additive algebraic structures on `α` (in other files), and reverses the order of multipliers in
multiplicative structures, i.e., `op (x * y) = op y * op x`, where `MulOpposite.op` is the
canonical map from `α` to `αᵐᵒᵖ`.

We also define `AddOpposite α = αᵃᵒᵖ` to be the additive opposite of `α`. It inherits all
multiplicative algebraic structures on `α` (in other files), and reverses the order of summands in
additive structures, i.e. `op (x + y) = op y + op x`, where `AddOpposite.op` is the canonical map
from `α` to `αᵃᵒᵖ`.

## Notation

* `αᵐᵒᵖ = MulOpposite α`
* `αᵃᵒᵖ = AddOpposite α`

## Implementation notes

In mathlib3 `αᵐᵒᵖ` was just a type synonym for `α`, marked irreducible after the API
was developed. In mathlib4 we use a structure with one field, because it is not possible
to change the reducibility of a declaration after its definition, and because Lean 4 has
definitional eta reduction for structures (Lean 3 does not).
