# Definitions of Archimedean monoids

This file defines the archimedean property for ordered monoids.

## Main definitions

* `Archimedean` is a typeclass for an ordered additive commutative monoid to have the archimedean
  property.
* `MulArchimedean` is a typeclass for an ordered commutative monoid to have the "mul-archimedean
  property" where for `x` and `y > 1`, there exists a natural number `n` such that `x ≤ y ^ n`.

class Archimedean (R) [AddCommMonoid R] [PartialOrder R] : Prop where
  /-- For any two elements `x`, `y` such that `0 < y`, there exists a natural number `n`
  such that `x ≤ n • y`. -/
  arch : ∀ (x : R) {y : R}, 0 < y → ∃ n : ℕ, x ≤ n • y
