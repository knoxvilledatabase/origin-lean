# Algebraic quotients

This file defines notation for algebraic quotients, e.g. quotient groups `G ⧸ H`,
quotient modules `M ⧸ N` and ideal quotients `R ⧸ I`.

The actual quotient structures are defined in the following files:
 * quotient group: `Mathlib/GroupTheory/QuotientGroup.lean`
 * quotient module: `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Quotient.lean`
 * quotient ring: `Mathlib/RingTheory/Ideal/Quotient.lean`

## Notations

The following notation is introduced:

* `G ⧸ H` stands for the quotient of the type `G` by some term `H`
  (for example, `H` can be a normal subgroup of `G`).
  To implement this notation for other quotients, you should provide a `HasQuotient` instance.
  Note that since `G` can usually be inferred from `H`, `_ ⧸ H` can also be used,
  but this is less readable.
