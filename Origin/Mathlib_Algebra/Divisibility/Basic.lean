# Divisibility

This file defines the basics of the divisibility relation in the context of `(Comm)` `Monoid`s.

## Main definitions

* `semigroupDvd`

## Implementation notes

The divisibility relation is defined for all monoids, and as such, depends on the order of
  multiplication if the monoid is not commutative. There are two possible conventions for
  divisibility in the noncommutative context, and this relation follows the convention for ordinals,
  so `a | b` is defined as `∃ c, b = a * c`.
