# Equivalence between types

In this file we define two types:

* `Equiv α β` a.k.a. `α ≃ β`: a bijective map `α → β` bundled with its inverse map; we use this (and
  not equality!) to express that various `Type`s or `Sort`s are equivalent.

* `Equiv.Perm α`: the group of permutations `α ≃ α`. More lemmas about `Equiv.Perm` can be found in
  `Mathlib/GroupTheory/Perm/`.

Then we define

* canonical isomorphisms between various types: e.g.,

  - `Equiv.refl α` is the identity map interpreted as `α ≃ α`;

* operations on equivalences: e.g.,

  - `Equiv.symm e : β ≃ α` is the inverse of `e : α ≃ β`;

  - `Equiv.trans e₁ e₂ : α ≃ γ` is the composition of `e₁ : α ≃ β` and `e₂ : β ≃ γ` (note the order
    of the arguments!);

* definitions that transfer some instances along an equivalence. By convention, we transfer
  instances from right to left.

  - `Equiv.inhabited` takes `e : α ≃ β` and `[Inhabited β]` and returns `Inhabited α`;
  - `Equiv.unique` takes `e : α ≃ β` and `[Unique β]` and returns `Unique α`;
  - `Equiv.decidableEq` takes `e : α ≃ β` and `[DecidableEq β]` and returns `DecidableEq α`.

  More definitions of this kind can be found in other files.
  E.g., `Mathlib/Algebra/Group/TransferInstance.lean` does it for `Group`,
  `Mathlib/Algebra/Module/TransferInstance.lean` does it for `Module`, and similar files exist for
  other algebraic type classes.

Many more such isomorphisms and operations are defined in `Mathlib/Logic/Equiv/Basic.lean`.
