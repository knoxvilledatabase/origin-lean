# Modelling partial recursive functions using Turing machines

The files `Config` and `ToPartrec` define a simplified basis for partial recursive functions,
and a `Turing.TM2` model
Turing machine for evaluating these functions. This amounts to a constructive proof that every
`Partrec` function can be evaluated by a Turing machine.

## Main definitions

* `ToPartrec.Code`: a simplified basis for partial recursive functions, valued in
  `List ℕ →. List ℕ`.
  * `ToPartrec.Code.eval`: semantics for a `ToPartrec.Code` program

## A simplified basis for partrec

This section constructs the type `Code`, which is a data type of programs with `List ℕ` input and
output, with enough expressivity to write any partial recursive function. The primitives are:

* `zero'` appends a `0` to the input. That is, `zero' v = 0 :: v`.
* `succ` returns the successor of the head of the input, defaulting to zero if there is no head:
  * `succ [] = [1]`
  * `succ (n :: v) = [n + 1]`
* `tail` returns the tail of the input
  * `tail [] = []`
  * `tail (n :: v) = v`
* `cons f fs` calls `f` and `fs` on the input and conses the results:
  * `cons f fs v = (f v).head :: fs v`
* `comp f g` calls `f` on the output of `g`:
  * `comp f g v = f (g v)`
* `case f g` cases on the head of the input, calling `f` or `g` depending on whether it is zero or
  a successor (similar to `Nat.casesOn`).
  * `case f g [] = f []`
  * `case f g (0 :: v) = f v`
  * `case f g (n+1 :: v) = g (n :: v)`
* `fix f` calls `f` repeatedly, using the head of the result of `f` to decide whether to call `f`
  again or finish:
  * `fix f v = []` if `f v = []`
  * `fix f v = w` if `f v = 0 :: w`
  * `fix f v = fix f w` if `f v = n+1 :: w` (the exact value of `n` is discarded)

This basis is convenient because it is closer to the Turing machine model - the key operations are
splitting and merging of lists of unknown length, while the messy `n`-ary composition operation
from the traditional basis for partial recursive functions is absent - but it retains a
compositional semantics. The first step in transitioning to Turing machines is to make a sequential
evaluator for this basis, which we take up in the next section.
