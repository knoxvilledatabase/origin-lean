# Computable functions

This file contains the definition of a Turing machine with some finiteness conditions
(bundling the definition of TM2 in `StackTuringMachine.lean`), a definition of when a TM gives
a certain output (in a certain time), and the definition of computability (in polynomial time or
any time function) of a function between two types that have an encoding (as in `Encoding.lean`).

## Main theorems

- `idComputableInPolyTime` : a TM + a proof it computes the identity on a type in polytime.
- `idComputable`           : a TM + a proof it computes the identity on a type.

## Implementation notes

To count the execution time of a Turing machine, we have decided to count the number of times the
`step` function is used. Each step executes a statement (of type `Stmt`); this is a function, and
generally contains multiple "fundamental" steps (pushing, popping, and so on).
However, as functions only contain a finite number of executions and each one is executed at most
once, this execution time is up to multiplication by a constant the amount of fundamental steps.
