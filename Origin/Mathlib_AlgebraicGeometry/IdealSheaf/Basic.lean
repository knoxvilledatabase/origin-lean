# Ideal sheaves on schemes

We define ideal sheaves of schemes and provide various constructors for it.

## Main definition
* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.IdealSheafData`: A structure that contains the data to uniquely define
  an ideal sheaf, consisting of
  1. an ideal `I(U) ≤ Γ(X, U)` for every affine open `U`
  2. a proof that `I(D(f)) = I(U)_f` for every affine open `U` and every section `f : Γ(X, U)`.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.IdealSheafData.ofIdeals`:
  The largest ideal sheaf contained in a family of ideals.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.IdealSheafData.equivOfIsAffine`:
  Over affine schemes, ideal sheaves are in bijection with ideals of the global sections.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.IdealSheafData.support`: The support of an ideal sheaf.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.IdealSheafData.vanishingIdeal`: The vanishing ideal of a set.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.ker`: The kernel of a morphism.

## Main results
* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.IdealSheafData.gc`:
  `support` and `vanishingIdeal` forms a Galois connection.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.support_ker`: The support of a kernel of a quasi-compact morphism
  is the closure of the range.

## Implementation detail

Ideal sheaves are not yet defined in this file as actual subsheaves of `𝒪ₓ`.
Instead, for the ease of development and application,
we define the structure `IdealSheafData` containing all necessary data to uniquely define an
ideal sheaf. This should be refactored as a constructor for ideal sheaves once they are introduced
into mathlib.
