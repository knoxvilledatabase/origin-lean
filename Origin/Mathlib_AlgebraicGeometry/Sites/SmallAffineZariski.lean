# The small affine Zariski site

`X.AffineZariskiSite` is the small affine Zariski site of `X`, whose elements are affine open
sets of `X`, and whose arrows are basic open sets `D(f) ⟶ U` for any `f : Γ(X, U)`.

Every presieve on `U` is then given by a `Set Γ(X, U)` (`presieveOfSections_surjective`), and
we endow `X.AffineZariskiSite` with `grothendieckTopology X`, such that `s : Set Γ(X, U)` is
a cover if and only if `Ideal.span s = ⊤` (`generate_presieveOfSections_mem_grothendieckTopology`).

This is a dense subsite of `X.Opens` (with respect to `Opens.grothendieckTopology X`) via the
inclusion functor `toOpensFunctor X`,
which gives an equivalence of categories of sheaves (`sheafEquiv`).

Note that this differs from the definition on stacks project where the arrows in the small affine
Zariski site are arbitrary inclusions.
