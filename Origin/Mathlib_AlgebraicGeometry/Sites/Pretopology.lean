# Grothendieck topology defined by a morphism property

Given a multiplicative morphism property `P` that is stable under base change, we define the
associated (pre)topology on the category of schemes, where coverings are given
by jointly surjective families of morphisms satisfying `P`.

## Implementation details

The pretopology is obtained from the precoverage `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.precoverage` defined in
`Mathlib.AlgebraicGeometry.Sites.MorphismProperty`. The definition is postponed to this file,
because the former does not have `HasPullbacks Scheme`.
