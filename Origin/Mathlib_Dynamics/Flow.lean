# Flows and invariant sets

This file defines a flow on a topological space `α` by a topological
monoid `τ` as a continuous monoid-action of `τ` on `α`. Anticipating the
cases where `τ` is one of `ℕ`, `ℤ`, `ℝ⁺`, or `ℝ`, we use additive
notation for the monoids, though the definition does not require
commutativity.

A subset `s` of `α` is invariant under a family of maps `ϕₜ : α → α`
if `ϕₜ s ⊆ s` for all `t`. In many cases `ϕ` will be a flow on
`α`. For the cases where `ϕ` is a flow by an ordered (additive,
commutative) monoid, we additionally define forward invariance, where
`t` ranges over those elements which are nonnegative.

Additionally, we define such constructions as the (forward) orbit, a
semiconjugacy between flows, a factor of a flow, the restriction of a
flow onto an invariant subset, and the time-reversal of a flow by a group.
