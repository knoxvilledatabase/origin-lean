# Minimal action of a group

In this file we define an action of a monoid `M` on a topological space `α` to be *minimal* if the
`M`-orbit of every point `x : α` is dense. We also provide an additive version of this definition
and prove some basic facts about minimal actions.

## TODO

* Define a minimal set of an action.
