# Functions satisfying a local predicate form a sheaf.

At this stage, in `Mathlib/Topology/Sheaves/SheafOfFunctions.lean`
we've proved that not-necessarily-continuous functions from a topological space
into some type (or type family) form a sheaf.

Why do the continuous functions form a sheaf?
The point is just that continuity is a local condition,
so one can use the lifting condition for functions to provide a candidate lift,
then verify that the lift is actually continuous by using the factorisation condition for the lift
(which guarantees that on each open set it agrees with the functions being lifted,
which were assumed to be continuous).

This file abstracts this argument to work for
any collection of dependent functions on a topological space
satisfying a "local predicate".

As an application, we check that continuity is a local predicate in this sense, and provide
* `TopCat.sheafToTop`: continuous functions into a topological space form a sheaf

A sheaf constructed in this way has a natural map `stalkToFiber` from the stalks
to the types in the ambient type family.

We give conditions sufficient to show that this map is injective and/or surjective.
