# Hölder continuous functions

In this file we define Hölder continuity on a set and on the whole space. We also prove some basic
properties of Hölder continuous functions.

## Main definitions

* `HolderOnWith`: `f : X → Y` is said to be *Hölder continuous* with constant `C : ℝ≥0` and
  exponent `r : ℝ≥0` on a set `s`, if `edist (f x) (f y) ≤ C * edist x y ^ r` for all `x y ∈ s`;
* `HolderWith`: `f : X → Y` is said to be *Hölder continuous* with constant `C : ℝ≥0` and exponent
  `r : ℝ≥0`, if `edist (f x) (f y) ≤ C * edist x y ^ r` for all `x y : X`.

## Implementation notes

We use the type `ℝ≥0` (a.k.a. `NNReal`) for `C` because this type has coercion both to `ℝ` and
`ℝ≥0∞`, so it can be easily used both in inequalities about `dist` and `edist`. We also use `ℝ≥0`
for `r` to ensure that `d ^ r` is monotone in `d`. It might be a good idea to use
`ℝ>0` for `r` but we don't have this type in `mathlib` (yet).
