# Effective epimorphisms in `Stonean`

This file proves that `EffectiveEpi`, `Epi` and `Surjective` are all equivalent in `Stonean`.
As a consequence we deduce from the material in
`Mathlib/Topology/Category/CompHausLike/EffectiveEpi.lean` that `Stonean` is `Preregular`
and `Precoherent`.

We also prove that for a finite family of morphisms in `Stonean` with fixed
target, the conditions jointly surjective, jointly epimorphic and effective epimorphic are all
equivalent.
