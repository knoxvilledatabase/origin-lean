# Homotopy between functions

In this file, we define a homotopy between two functions `f₀` and `f₁`. First we define
`ContinuousMap.Homotopy` between the two functions, with no restrictions on the intermediate
maps. Then, as in the formalisation in HOL-Analysis, we define
`ContinuousMap.HomotopyWith f₀ f₁ P`, for homotopies between `f₀` and `f₁`, where the
intermediate maps satisfy the predicate `P`. Finally, we define
`ContinuousMap.HomotopyRel f₀ f₁ S`, for homotopies between `f₀` and `f₁` which are fixed
on `S`.

## Definitions

* `ContinuousMap.Homotopy f₀ f₁` is the type of homotopies between `f₀` and `f₁`.
* `ContinuousMap.HomotopyWith f₀ f₁ P` is the type of homotopies between `f₀` and `f₁`, where
  the intermediate maps satisfy the predicate `P`.
* `ContinuousMap.HomotopyRel f₀ f₁ S` is the type of homotopies between `f₀` and `f₁` which
  are fixed on `S`.

For each of the above, we have

* `refl f`, which is the constant homotopy from `f` to `f`.
* `symm F`, which reverses the homotopy `F`. For example, if `F : ContinuousMap.Homotopy f₀ f₁`,
  then `F.symm : ContinuousMap.Homotopy f₁ f₀`.
* `trans F G`, which concatenates the homotopies `F` and `G`. For example, if
  `F : ContinuousMap.Homotopy f₀ f₁` and `G : ContinuousMap.Homotopy f₁ f₂`, then
  `F.trans G : ContinuousMap.Homotopy f₀ f₂`.

We also define the relations

* `ContinuousMap.Homotopic f₀ f₁` is defined to be `Nonempty (ContinuousMap.Homotopy f₀ f₁)`
* `ContinuousMap.HomotopicWith f₀ f₁ P` is defined to be
  `Nonempty (ContinuousMap.HomotopyWith f₀ f₁ P)`
* `ContinuousMap.HomotopicRel f₀ f₁ P` is defined to be
  `Nonempty (ContinuousMap.HomotopyRel f₀ f₁ P)`

and for `ContinuousMap.homotopic` and `ContinuousMap.homotopic_rel`, we also define the
`setoid` and `quotient` in `C(X, Y)` by these relations.
