# Continuous partition of unity

In this file we define `PartitionOfUnity (ι X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] (s : Set X := univ)`
to be a continuous partition of unity on `s` indexed by `ι`. More precisely,
`f : PartitionOfUnity ι X s` is a collection of continuous functions `f i : C(X, ℝ)`, `i : ι`,
such that

* the supports of `f i` form a locally finite family of sets;
* each `f i` is nonnegative;
* `∑ᶠ i, f i x = 1` for all `x ∈ s`;
* `∑ᶠ i, f i x ≤ 1` for all `x : X`.

In the case `s = univ` the last assumption follows from the previous one but it is convenient to
have this assumption in the case `s ≠ univ`.

We also define a bump function covering,
`BumpCovering (ι X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] (s : Set X := univ)`, to be a collection of
functions `f i : C(X, ℝ)`, `i : ι`, such that

* the supports of `f i` form a locally finite family of sets;
* each `f i` is nonnegative;
* for each `x ∈ s` there exists `i : ι` such that `f i y = 1` in a neighborhood of `x`.

The term is motivated by the smooth case.

If `f` is a bump function covering indexed by a linearly ordered type, then
`g i x = f i x * ∏ᶠ j < i, (1 - f j x)` is a partition of unity, see
`BumpCovering.toPartitionOfUnity`. Note that only finitely many terms `1 - f j x` are not equal
to one, so this product is well-defined.

Note that `g i x = ∏ᶠ j < i, (1 - f j x) - ∏ᶠ j ≤ i, (1 - f j x)`, so most terms in the sum
`∑ᶠ i, g i x` cancel, and we get `∑ᶠ i, g i x = 1 - ∏ᶠ i, (1 - f i x)`, and the latter product
equals zero because one of `f i x` is equal to one.

We say that a partition of unity or a bump function covering `f` is *subordinate* to a family of
sets `U i`, `i : ι`, if the closure of the support of each `f i` is included in `U i`. We use
Urysohn's Lemma to prove that a locally finite open covering of a normal topological space admits a
subordinate bump function covering (hence, a subordinate partition of unity), see
`BumpCovering.exists_isSubordinate_of_locallyFinite`. If `X` is a paracompact space, then any
open covering admits a locally finite refinement, hence it admits a subordinate bump function
covering and a subordinate partition of unity, see `BumpCovering.exists_isSubordinate`.

We also provide two slightly more general versions of these lemmas,
`BumpCovering.exists_isSubordinate_of_locallyFinite_of_prop` and
`BumpCovering.exists_isSubordinate_of_prop`, to be used later in the construction of a smooth
partition of unity.

## Implementation notes

Most (if not all) books only define a partition of unity of the whole space. However, quite a few
proofs only deal with `f i` such that `tsupport (f i)` meets a specific closed subset, and
it is easier to formalize these proofs if we don't have other functions right away.

We use `WellOrderingRel j i` instead of `j < i` in the definition of
`BumpCovering.toPartitionOfUnity` to avoid a `[LinearOrder ι]` assumption. While
`WellOrderingRel j i` is a well order, not only a strict linear order, we never use this property.
