# Definitions about topological groups

In this file we define mixin classes `ContinuousInv`, `IsTopologicalGroup`, and `ContinuousDiv`,
as well as their additive versions.

These classes say that the corresponding operations are continuous:

- `ContinuousInv G` says that `(·⁻¹)` is continuous on `G`;
- `IsTopologicalGroup G` says that `(· * ·)` is continuous on `G × G`
  and `(·⁻¹)` is continuous on `G`;
- `ContinuousDiv G` says that `(· / ·)` is continuous on `G`.

For groups, `ContinuousDiv G` is equivalent to `IsTopologicalGroup G`,
but we use the additive version `ContinuousSub` for types like `NNReal`,
where subtraction is not given by `a - b = a + (-b)`.

We also provide convenience dot notation lemmas like `ContinuousAt.neg`.
