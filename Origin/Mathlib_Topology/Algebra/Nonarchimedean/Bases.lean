# Neighborhood bases for non-archimedean rings and modules

This file contains special families of filter bases on rings and modules that give rise to
non-archimedean topologies.

The main definition is `RingSubgroupsBasis` which is a predicate on a family of
additive subgroups of a ring. The predicate ensures there is a topology
`RingSubgroupsBasis.topology` which is compatible with a ring structure and admits the given
family as a basis of neighborhoods of zero. In particular, the given subgroups become open subgroups
(bundled in `RingSubgroupsBasis.openAddSubgroup`) and we get a non-archimedean topological ring
(`RingSubgroupsBasis.nonarchimedean`).

A special case of this construction is given by `SubmodulesBasis` where the subgroups are
sub-modules in a commutative algebra. This important example gives rise to the adic topology
(studied in its own file).
