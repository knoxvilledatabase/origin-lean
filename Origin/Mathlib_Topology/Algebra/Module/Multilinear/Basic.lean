# Continuous multilinear maps

We define continuous multilinear maps as maps from `(i : ι) → M₁ i` to `M₂` which are multilinear
and continuous, by extending the space of multilinear maps with a continuity assumption.
Here, `M₁ i` and `M₂` are modules over a ring `R`, and `ι` is an arbitrary type, and all these
spaces are also topological spaces.

## Main definitions

* `ContinuousMultilinearMap R M₁ M₂` is the space of continuous multilinear maps from
  `(i : ι) → M₁ i` to `M₂`. We show that it is an `R`-module.

## Implementation notes

We mostly follow the API of multilinear maps.

## Notation

We introduce the notation `M [×n]→L[R] M'` for the space of continuous `n`-multilinear maps from
`M^n` to `M'`. This is a particular case of the general notion (where we allow varying dependent
types as the arguments of our continuous multilinear maps), but arguably the most important one,
especially when defining iterated derivatives.
