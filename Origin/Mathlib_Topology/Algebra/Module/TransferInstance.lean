# Transfer topological algebraic structures across `Equiv`s

In this file, we construct a continuous linear equivalence `α ≃L[R] β` from an equivalence `α ≃ β`,
where the continuous `R`-module structure on `α` is the one obtained by transporting an
`R`-module structure on `β` back along `e`.
We also specialize this construction to `Shrink α`.

This continues the pattern set in `Mathlib/Algebra/Module/TransferInstance.lean`.
