# Topological facts about upper/lower/order-connected sets

The topological closure and interior of an upper/lower/order-connected set is an
upper/lower/order-connected set (with the notable exception of the closure of an order-connected
set).

## Implementation notes

The same lemmas are true in the additive/multiplicative worlds. To avoid code duplication, we
provide `HasUpperLowerClosure`, an ad hoc axiomatisation of the properties we need.
