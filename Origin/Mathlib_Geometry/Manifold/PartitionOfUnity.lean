# Smooth partition of unity

In this file we define two structures, `SmoothBumpCovering` and `SmoothPartitionOfUnity`. Both
structures describe coverings of a set by a locally finite family of supports of smooth functions
with some additional properties. The former structure is mostly useful as an intermediate step in
the construction of a smooth partition of unity but some proofs that traditionally deal with a
partition of unity can use a `SmoothBumpCovering` as well.

Given a real manifold `M` and its subset `s`, a `SmoothBumpCovering ι I M s` is a collection of
`SmoothBumpFunction`s `f i` indexed by `i : ι` such that

* the center of each `f i` belongs to `s`;
* the family of sets `support (f i)` is locally finite;
* for each `x ∈ s`, there exists `i : ι` such that `f i =ᶠ[𝓝 x] 1`.

In the same settings, a `SmoothPartitionOfUnity ι I M s` is a collection of smooth nonnegative
functions `f i : C^∞⟮I, M; 𝓘(ℝ), ℝ⟯`, `i : ι`, such that

* the family of sets `support (f i)` is locally finite;
* for each `x ∈ s`, the sum `∑ᶠ i, f i x` equals one;
* for each `x`, the sum `∑ᶠ i, f i x` is less than or equal to one.

We say that `f : SmoothBumpCovering ι I M s` is *subordinate* to a map `U : M → Set M` if for each
index `i`, we have `tsupport (f i) ⊆ U (f i).c`. This notion is a bit more general than
being subordinate to an open covering of `M`, because we make no assumption about the way `U x`
depends on `x`.

We prove that on a smooth finite-dimensional real manifold with `σ`-compact Hausdorff topology,
for any `U : M → Set M` such that `∀ x ∈ s, U x ∈ 𝓝 x` there exists a `SmoothBumpCovering ι I M s`
subordinate to `U`. Then we use this fact to prove a similar statement about smooth partitions of
unity, see `SmoothPartitionOfUnity.exists_isSubordinate`.

Finally, we use existence of a partition of unity to prove lemma
`exists_contMDiffMap_forall_mem_convex_of_local` that allows us to construct a globally defined
smooth function from local functions.

## TODO

* Build a framework to transfer local definitions to global using partition of unity and use it
  to define, e.g., the integral of a differential form over a manifold. Lemma
  `exists_contMDiffMap_forall_mem_convex_of_local` is a first step in this direction.

### Covering by supports of smooth bump functions

In this section we define `SmoothBumpCovering ι I M s` to be a collection of
`SmoothBumpFunction`s such that their supports are a locally finite family of sets and for each
`x ∈ s` some function `f i` from the collection is equal to `1` in a neighborhood of `x`. A covering
of this type is useful to construct a smooth partition of unity and can be used instead of a
partition of unity in some proofs.

We prove that on a smooth finite-dimensional real manifold with `σ`-compact Hausdorff topology, for
any `U : M → Set M` such that `∀ x ∈ s, U x ∈ 𝓝 x` there exists a `SmoothBumpCovering ι I M s`
subordinate to `U`. -/
