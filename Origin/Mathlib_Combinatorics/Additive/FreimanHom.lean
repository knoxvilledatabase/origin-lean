# Freiman homomorphisms

In this file, we define Freiman homomorphisms and isomorphisms.

An `n`-Freiman homomorphism from `A` to `B` is a function `f : α → β` such that `f '' A ⊆ B` and
`f x₁ * ... * f xₙ = f y₁ * ... * f yₙ` for all `x₁, ..., xₙ, y₁, ..., yₙ ∈ A` such that
`x₁ * ... * xₙ = y₁ * ... * yₙ`. In particular, any `MulHom` is a Freiman homomorphism.

Note a `0`- or `1`-Freiman homomorphism is simply a map, thus a `2`-Freiman homomorphism is the
first interesting case (and the most common). As `n` increases further, the property of being
an `n`-Freiman homomorphism between abelian groups becomes increasingly stronger.

An `n`-Freiman isomorphism from `A` to `B` is a function `f : α → β` bijective between `A` and `B`
such that `f x₁ * ... * f xₙ = f y₁ * ... * f yₙ ↔ x₁ * ... * xₙ = y₁ * ... * yₙ` for all
`x₁, ..., xₙ, y₁, ..., yₙ ∈ A`. In particular, any `MulEquiv` is a Freiman isomorphism.

They are of interest in additive combinatorics.

## Main declarations

* `IsMulFreimanHom`: Predicate for a function to be a multiplicative Freiman homomorphism.
* `IsAddFreimanHom`: Predicate for a function to be an additive Freiman homomorphism.
* `IsMulFreimanIso`: Predicate for a function to be a multiplicative Freiman isomorphism.
* `IsAddFreimanIso`: Predicate for a function to be an additive Freiman isomorphism.

## Main results

* `isMulFreimanHom_two`: Characterisation of `2`-Freiman homomorphisms.
* `IsMulFreimanHom.mono`: If `m ≤ n` and `f` is an `n`-Freiman homomorphism, then it is also an
  `m`-Freiman homomorphism.

## Implementation notes

In the context of combinatorics, we are interested in Freiman homomorphisms over sets which are not
necessarily closed under addition/multiplication. This means we must parametrize them with a set in
an `AddMonoid`/`Monoid` instead of the `AddMonoid`/`Monoid` itself.

## TODO

* `MonoidHomClass.isMulFreimanHom` could be relaxed to `MulHom.toFreimanHom` by proving
  `(s.map f).prod = (t.map f).prod` directly by induction instead of going through `f s.prod`.
* Affine maps are Freiman homomorphisms.
