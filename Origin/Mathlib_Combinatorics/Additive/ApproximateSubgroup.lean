# Approximate subgroups

This file defines approximate subgroups of a group, namely symmetric sets `A` such that `A * A` can
be covered by a small number of translates of `A`.

## Main results

Approximate subgroups are a central concept in additive combinatorics, as a natural weakening and
flexible substitute of genuine subgroups. As such, they share numerous properties with subgroups:
* `IsApproximateSubgroup.image`: Group homomorphisms send approximate subgroups to approximate
  subgroups
* `IsApproximateSubgroup.pow_inter_pow`: The intersection of (non-trivial powers of) two approximate
  subgroups is an approximate subgroup. Warning: The intersection of two approximate subgroups isn't
  an approximate subgroup in general.

Approximate subgroups are close qualitatively and quantitatively to other concepts in additive
combinatorics:
* `IsApproximateSubgroup.card_pow_le`: An approximate subgroup has small powers.
* `IsApproximateSubgroup.of_small_tripling`: A set of small tripling can be made an approximate
  subgroup by squaring.

It can be readily confirmed that approximate subgroups are a weakening of subgroups:
* `isApproximateSubgroup_one`: A 1-approximate subgroup is the same thing as a subgroup.
