# Derangements on fintypes

This file contains lemmas that describe the cardinality of `derangements α` when `α` is a fintype.

## Main definitions

* `card_derangements_invariant`: A lemma stating that the number of derangements on a type `α`
    depends only on the cardinality of `α`.
* `numDerangements n`: The number of derangements on an n-element set, defined in a computation-
    friendly way.
* `card_derangements_eq_numDerangements`: Proof that `numDerangements` really does compute the
    number of derangements.
* `numDerangements_sum`: A lemma giving an expression for `numDerangements n` in terms of
    factorials.
