# Adjacency Matrices

This module defines the adjacency matrix of a graph, and provides theorems connecting graph
properties to computational properties of the matrix.

## Main definitions

* `Matrix.IsAdjMatrix`: `A : Matrix V V α` is qualified as an "adjacency matrix" if
  (1) every entry of `A` is `0` or `1`,
  (2) `A` is symmetric,
  (3) every diagonal entry of `A` is `0`.

* `Matrix.IsAdjMatrix.toGraph`: for `A : Matrix V V α` and `h : A.IsAdjMatrix`,
  `h.toGraph` is the simple graph induced by `A`.

* `Matrix.compl`: for `A : Matrix V V α`, `A.compl` is supposed to be
  the adjacency matrix of the complement graph of the graph induced by `A`.

* `SimpleGraph.adjMatrix`: the adjacency matrix of a `SimpleGraph`.

* `SimpleGraph.adjMatrix_pow_apply_eq_card_walk`: each entry of the `n`th power of
  a graph's adjacency matrix counts the number of length-`n` walks between the corresponding
  pair of vertices.
