# Adjoint of operators on Hilbert spaces

Given an operator `A : E →L[𝕜] F`, where `E` and `F` are Hilbert spaces, its adjoint
`adjoint A : F →L[𝕜] E` is the unique operator such that `⟪x, A y⟫ = ⟪adjoint A x, y⟫` for all
`x` and `y`.

We then use this to put a C⋆-algebra structure on `E →L[𝕜] E` with the adjoint as the star
operation.

This construction is used to define an adjoint for linear maps (i.e. not continuous) between
finite-dimensional spaces.

## Main definitions

* `ContinuousLinearMap.adjoint : (E →L[𝕜] F) ≃ₗᵢ⋆[𝕜] (F →L[𝕜] E)`: the adjoint of a continuous
  linear map, bundled as a conjugate-linear isometric equivalence.
* `LinearMap.adjoint : (E →ₗ[𝕜] F) ≃ₗ⋆[𝕜] (F →ₗ[𝕜] E)`: the adjoint of a linear map between
  finite-dimensional spaces, this time only as a conjugate-linear equivalence, since there is no
  norm defined on these maps.

## Implementation notes

* The continuous conjugate-linear version `adjointAux` is only an intermediate
  definition and is not meant to be used outside this file.
