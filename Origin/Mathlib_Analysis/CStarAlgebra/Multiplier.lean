# Multiplier Algebra of a C⋆-algebra

Define the multiplier algebra of a C⋆-algebra as the algebra (over `𝕜`) of double centralizers,
for which we provide the localized notation `𝓜(𝕜, A)`.  A double centralizer is a pair of
continuous linear maps `L R : A →L[𝕜] A` satisfying the intertwining condition `R x * y = x * L y`.

There is a natural embedding `A → 𝓜(𝕜, A)` which sends `a : A` to the continuous linear maps
`L R : A →L[𝕜] A` given by left and right multiplication by `a`, and we provide this map as a
coercion.

The multiplier algebra corresponds to a non-commutative Stone–Čech compactification in the sense
that when the algebra `A` is commutative, it can be identified with `C₀(X, ℂ)` for some locally
compact Hausdorff space `X`, and in that case `𝓜(𝕜, A)` can be identified with `C(β X, ℂ)`.

## Implementation notes

We make the hypotheses on `𝕜` as weak as possible so that, in particular, this construction works
for both `𝕜 = ℝ` and `𝕜 = ℂ`.

The reader familiar with C⋆-algebra theory may recognize that one
only needs `L` and `R` to be functions instead of continuous linear maps, at least when `A` is a
C⋆-algebra. Our intention is simply to eventually provide a constructor for this situation.

We pull back the `NormedAlgebra` structure (and everything contained therein) through the
ring (even algebra) homomorphism
`DoubleCentralizer.toProdMulOppositeHom : 𝓜(𝕜, A) →+* (A →L[𝕜] A) × (A →L[𝕜] A)ᵐᵒᵖ` which
sends `a : 𝓜(𝕜, A)` to `(a.fst, MulOpposite.op a.snd)`. The star structure is provided
separately.

## TODO

+ Define a type synonym for `𝓜(𝕜, A)` which is equipped with the strict uniform space structure
  and show it is complete
+ Show that the image of `A` in `𝓜(𝕜, A)` is an essential ideal
+ Prove the universal property of `𝓜(𝕜, A)`
+ Construct a double centralizer from a pair of maps (not necessarily linear or continuous)
  `L : A → A`, `R : A → A` satisfying the centrality condition `∀ x y, R x * y = x * L y`.
+ Show that if `A` is unital, then `A ≃⋆ₐ[𝕜] 𝓜(𝕜, A)`.
