# Super-Polynomial Function Decay

This file defines a predicate `Asymptotics.SuperpolynomialDecay f` for a function satisfying
one of the following equivalent definitions (the definition is in terms of the first condition):

* `x ^ n * f` tends to `𝓝 0` for all (or sufficiently large) naturals `n`
* `|x ^ n * f|` tends to `𝓝 0` for all naturals `n` (`superpolynomialDecay_iff_abs_tendsto_zero`)
* `|x ^ n * f|` is bounded for all naturals `n` (`superpolynomialDecay_iff_abs_isBoundedUnder`)
* `f` is `o(x ^ c)` for all integers `c` (`superpolynomialDecay_iff_isLittleO`)
* `f` is `O(x ^ c)` for all integers `c` (`superpolynomialDecay_iff_isBigO`)

These conditions are all equivalent to conditions in terms of polynomials, replacing `x ^ c` with
  `p(x)` or `p(x)⁻¹` as appropriate, since asymptotically `p(x)` behaves like `X ^ p.natDegree`.
These further equivalences are not proven in mathlib but would be good future projects.

The definition of superpolynomial decay for `f : α → β` is relative to a parameter `k : α → β`.
Super-polynomial decay then means `f x` decays faster than `(k x) ^ c` for all integers `c`.
Equivalently `f x` decays faster than `p.eval (k x)` for all polynomials `p : β[X]`.
The definition is also relative to a filter `l : Filter α` where the decay rate is compared.

When the map `k` is given by `n ↦ ↑n : ℕ → ℝ` this defines negligible functions:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligible_function

When the map `k` is given by `(r₁,...,rₙ) ↦ r₁*...*rₙ : ℝⁿ → ℝ` this is equivalent
  to the definition of rapidly decreasing functions given here:
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/rapidly+decreasing+function

## Main statements

* `SuperpolynomialDecay.polynomial_mul` says that if `f(x)` is negligible,
    then so is `p(x) * f(x)` for any polynomial `p`.
* `superpolynomialDecay_iff_zpow_tendsto_zero` gives an equivalence between definitions in terms
    of decaying faster than `k(x) ^ n` for all naturals `n` or `k(x) ^ c` for all integer `c`.
