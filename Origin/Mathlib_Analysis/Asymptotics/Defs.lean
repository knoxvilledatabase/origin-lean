# Asymptotics

We introduce these relations:

* `IsBigOWith c l f g` : "f is big O of g along l with constant c";
* `f =O[l] g` : "f is big O of g along l";
* `f =Θ[l] g` : "f is big O of g along l and vice versa";
* `f =o[l] g` : "f is little o of g along l";
* `f ~[l] g` : `f` and `g` are equivalent, i.e., `f - g =o[l] g`.

Here `l` is any filter on the domain of `f` and `g`, which are assumed to be the same. The codomains
of `f` and `g` do not need to be the same; all that is needed is that there is a norm associated
with these types, and it is the norm that is compared asymptotically.

The relation `IsBigOWith c` is introduced to factor out common algebraic arguments in the proofs of
similar properties of `IsBigO` and `IsLittleO`. Usually proofs outside of this file should use
`IsBigO` instead.

Often the ranges of `f` and `g` will be the real numbers, in which case the norm is the absolute
value. In general, we have

  `f =O[l] g ↔ (fun x ↦ ‖f x‖) =O[l] (fun x ↦ ‖g x‖)`,

and similarly for `IsLittleO`. But our setup allows us to use the notions e.g. with functions
to the integers, rationals, complex numbers, or any normed vector space without mentioning the
norm explicitly.

If `f` and `g` are functions to a normed field like the reals or complex numbers and `g` is always
nonzero, we have

  `f =o[l] g ↔ Tendsto (fun x ↦ f x / (g x)) l (𝓝 0)`.

In fact, the right-to-left direction holds without the hypothesis on `g`, and in the other direction
it suffices to assume that `f` is zero wherever `g` is. (This generalization is useful in defining
the Fréchet derivative.)

Sometimes Landau notation may be embedded in more complex expressions, such as
$f(n) = n ^ {1 + O(g(n))}$. This can be expressed using the existential pattern, for example:

  `∃ (e : ℕ → ℝ) (he : e =O[l] g), f =ᶠ[l] fun n ↦ n ^ (1 + e n)`.
