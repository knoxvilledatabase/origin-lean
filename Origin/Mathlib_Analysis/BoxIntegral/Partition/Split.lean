# Split a box along one or more hyperplanes

## Main definitions

A hyperplane `{x : ι → ℝ | x i = a}` splits a rectangular box `I : BoxIntegral.Box ι` into two
smaller boxes. If `a ∉ Ioo (I.lower i, I.upper i)`, then one of these boxes is empty, so it is not a
box in the sense of `BoxIntegral.Box`.

We introduce the following definitions.

* `BoxIntegral.Box.splitLower I i a` and `BoxIntegral.Box.splitUpper I i a` are these boxes (as
  `WithBot (BoxIntegral.Box ι)`);
* `BoxIntegral.Prepartition.split I i a` is the partition of `I` made of these two boxes (or of one
  box `I` if one of these boxes is empty);
* `BoxIntegral.Prepartition.splitMany I s`, where `s : Finset (ι × ℝ)` is a finite set of
  hyperplanes `{x : ι → ℝ | x i = a}` encoded as pairs `(i, a)`, is the partition of `I` made by
  cutting it along all the hyperplanes in `s`.

## Main results

The main result `BoxIntegral.Prepartition.exists_iUnion_eq_diff` says that any prepartition `π` of
`I` admits a prepartition `π'` of `I` that covers exactly `I \ π.iUnion`. One of these prepartitions
is available as `BoxIntegral.Prepartition.compl`.
