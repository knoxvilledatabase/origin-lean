# Finite-dimensional normed spaces over complete fields

Over a complete nontrivially normed field, in finite dimension, all norms are equivalent and all
linear maps are continuous. Moreover, a finite-dimensional subspace is always complete and closed.

## Main results:

* `FiniteDimensional.complete` : a finite-dimensional space over a complete field is complete. This
  is not registered as an instance, as the field would be an unknown metavariable in typeclass
  resolution.
* `Submodule.closed_of_finiteDimensional` : a finite-dimensional subspace over a complete field is
  closed
* `FiniteDimensional.proper` : a finite-dimensional space over a proper field is proper. This
  is not registered as an instance, as the field would be an unknown metavariable in typeclass
  resolution. It is however registered as an instance for `𝕜 = ℝ` and `𝕜 = ℂ`. As properness
  implies completeness, there is no need to also register `FiniteDimensional.complete` on `ℝ` or
  `ℂ`.
* `FiniteDimensional.of_isCompact_closedBall`: Riesz' theorem: if the closed unit ball is
  compact, then the space is finite-dimensional.

## Implementation notes

The fact that all norms are equivalent is not written explicitly, as it would mean having two norms
on a single space, which is not the way type classes work. However, if one has a
finite-dimensional vector space `E` with a norm, and a copy `E'` of this type with another norm,
then the identities from `E` to `E'` and from `E'` to `E` are continuous thanks to
`LinearMap.continuous_of_finiteDimensional`. This gives the desired norm equivalence.
