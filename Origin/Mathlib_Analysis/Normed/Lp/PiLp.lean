# `L^p` distance on finite products of metric spaces
Given finitely many metric spaces, one can put the max distance on their product, but there is also
a whole family of natural distances, indexed by a parameter `p : ℝ≥0∞`, that also induce
the product topology. We define them in this file. For `0 < p < ∞`, the distance on `Π i, α i`
is given by
$$
d(x, y) = \left(\sum d(x_i, y_i)^p\right)^{1/p}.
$$,
whereas for `p = 0` it is the cardinality of the set ${i | d (x_i, y_i) ≠ 0}$. For `p = ∞` the
distance is the supremum of the distances.

We give instances of this construction for emetric spaces, metric spaces, normed groups and normed
spaces.

To avoid conflicting instances, all these are defined on a copy of the original Π-type, named
`PiLp p α`. The assumption `[Fact (1 ≤ p)]` is required for the metric and normed space instances.

We ensure that the topology, bornology and uniform structure on `PiLp p α` are (defeq to) the
product topology, product bornology and product uniformity, to be able to use freely continuity
statements for the coordinate functions, for instance.

If you wish to endow a type synonym of `Π i, α i` with the `L^p` distance, you can use
`pseudoMetricSpaceToPi` and the declarations below that one.

## Implementation notes

We only deal with the `L^p` distance on a product of finitely many metric spaces, which may be
distinct. A closely related construction is `lp`, the `L^p` norm on a product of (possibly
infinitely many) normed spaces, where the norm is
$$
\left(\sum ‖f (x)‖^p \right)^{1/p}.
$$
However, the topology induced by this construction is not the product topology, and some functions
have infinite `L^p` norm. These subtleties are not present in the case of finitely many metric
spaces, hence it is worth devoting a file to this specific case which is particularly well behaved.

Another related construction is `MeasureTheory.Lp`, the `L^p` norm on the space of functions from
a measure space to a normed space, where the norm is
$$
\left(\int ‖f (x)‖^p dμ\right)^{1/p}.
$$
This has all the same subtleties as `lp`, and the further subtlety that this only
defines a seminorm (as almost everywhere zero functions have zero `L^p` norm).
The construction `PiLp` corresponds to the special case of `MeasureTheory.Lp` in which the basis
is a finite space equipped with the counting measure.

To prove that the topology (and the uniform structure) on a finite product with the `L^p` distance
are the same as those coming from the `L^∞` distance, we could argue that the `L^p` and `L^∞` norms
are equivalent on `ℝ^n` for abstract (norm equivalence) reasons. Instead, we give a more explicit
(easy) proof which provides a comparison between these two norms with explicit constants.

We also set up the theory for `PseudoEMetricSpace` and `PseudoMetricSpace`.

## TODO

TODO: the results about uniformity and bornology in the `Aux` section should be using the tools in
`Mathlib.Topology.MetricSpace.Bilipschitz`, so that they can be inlined in the next section and
the only remaining results are about `Lipschitz` and `Antilipschitz`.
