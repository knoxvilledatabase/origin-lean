# Picard-Lindelöf (Cauchy-Lipschitz) Theorem

We prove the (local) existence of integral curves and flows to time-dependent vector fields.

Let `f : ℝ → E → E` be a time-dependent (local) vector field on a Banach space, and let `t₀ : ℝ`
and `x₀ : E`. If `f` is Lipschitz continuous in `x` within a closed ball around `x₀` of radius
`a ≥ 0` at every `t` and continuous in `t` at every `x`, then there exists a (local) solution
`α : ℝ → E` to the initial value problem `α t₀ = x₀` and `deriv α t = f t (α t)` for all
`t ∈ Icc tmin tmax`, where `L * max (tmax - t₀) (t₀ - tmin) ≤ a`.

We actually prove a more general version of this theorem for the existence of local flows. If there
is some `r ≥ 0` such that `L * max (tmax - t₀) (t₀ - tmin) ≤ a - r`, then for every
`x ∈ closedBall x₀ r`, there exists a (local) solution `α x` with the initial condition `α t₀ = x`.
In other words, there exists a local flow `α : E → ℝ → E` defined on `closedBall x₀ r` and
`Icc tmin tmax`.

The proof relies on demonstrating the existence of a solution `α` to the following integral
equation:
$$\alpha(t) = x_0 + \int_{t_0}^t f(\tau, \alpha(\tau))\,\mathrm{d}\tau.$$
This is done via the contraction mapping theorem, applied to the space of Lipschitz continuous
functions from a closed interval to a Banach space. The needed contraction map is constructed by
repeated applications of the right-hand side of this equation.

## Main definitions and results

* `picard f t₀ x₀ α t`: the Picard iteration, applied to the curve `α`
* `IsPicardLindelof`: the structure holding the assumptions of the Picard-Lindelöf theorem
* `IsPicardLindelof.exists_eq_forall_mem_Icc_hasDerivWithinAt`: the existence theorem for local
  solutions to time-dependent ODEs
* `IsPicardLindelof.exists_forall_mem_closedBall_eq_forall_mem_Icc_hasDerivWithinAt`: the existence
  theorem for local flows to time-dependent vector fields
* `IsPicardLindelof.exists_forall_mem_closedBall_eq_hasDerivWithinAt_lipschitzOnWith`: there exists
  a local flow to time-dependent vector fields, and it is Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the
  starting point.

## Implementation notes

* The structure `FunSpace` and theorems within this namespace are implementation details of the
  proof of the Picard-Lindelöf theorem and are not intended to be used outside of this file.
* Some sources, such as Lang, define `FunSpace` as the space of continuous functions from a closed
  interval to a closed ball. We instead define `FunSpace` here as the space of Lipschitz continuous
  functions from a closed interval. This slightly stronger condition allows us to postpone the usage
  of the completeness condition on the space `E` until the application of the contraction mapping
  theorem.
* We have chosen to formalise many of the real constants as `ℝ≥0`, so that the non-negativity of
  certain quantities constructed from them can be shown more easily. When subtraction is involved,
  especially note whether it is the usual subtraction between two reals or the truncated subtraction
  between two non-negative reals.
* In this file, We only prove the existence of a solution. For uniqueness, see `ODE_solution_unique`
  and related theorems in `Mathlib/Analysis/ODE/Gronwall.lean`.
