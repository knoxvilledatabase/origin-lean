# Bernstein approximations and Weierstrass' theorem

We prove that the Bernstein approximations
```
∑ k : Fin (n+1), (n.choose k * x^k * (1-x)^(n-k)) • f (k/n : ℝ)
```
for a continuous function `f : C([0,1], E)` taking values in a locally convex vector space
converge uniformly to `f` as `n` tends to infinity.
This statement directly applies to the cases when the codomain is a (semi)normed space
or, more generally, has a topology defined by a family of seminorms.

Our proof follows [Richard Beals' *Analysis, an introduction*][beals-analysis], §7D.
The original proof, due to [Bernstein](bernstein1912) in 1912, is probabilistic,
and relies on Bernoulli's theorem,
which gives bounds for how quickly the observed frequencies in a
Bernoulli trial approach the underlying probability.

The proof here does not directly rely on Bernoulli's theorem,
but can also be given a probabilistic account.
* Consider a weighted coin which with probability `x` produces heads,
  and with probability `1-x` produces tails.
* The value of `bernstein n k x` is the probability that
  such a coin gives exactly `k` heads in a sequence of `n` tosses.
* If such an appearance of `k` heads results in a payoff of `f(k / n)`,
  the `n`-th Bernstein approximation for `f` evaluated at `x` is the expected payoff.
* The main estimate in the proof bounds the probability that
  the observed frequency of heads differs from `x` by more than some `δ`,
  obtaining a bound of `(4 * n * δ^2)⁻¹`, irrespective of `x`.
* This ensures that for `n` large, the Bernstein approximation is (uniformly) close to the
  payoff function `f`.

(You don't need to think in these terms to follow the proof below: it's a giant `calc` block!)

This result proves Weierstrass' theorem that polynomials are dense in `C([0,1], ℝ)`,
although we defer an abstract statement of this until later.
