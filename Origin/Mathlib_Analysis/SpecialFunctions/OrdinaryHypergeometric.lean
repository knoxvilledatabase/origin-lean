# Ordinary hypergeometric function in a Banach algebra

In this file, we define `ordinaryHypergeometric`, the _ordinary_ or _Gaussian_ hypergeometric
function in a topological algebra `𝔸` over a field `𝕂` given by:
$$
_2\mathrm{F}_1(a\ b\ c : \mathbb{K}, x : \mathbb{A}) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(a)_n(b)_n}{(c)_n}
\frac{x^n}{n!}   \,,
$$
with $(a)_n$ is the ascending Pochhammer symbol (see `ascPochhammer`).

This file contains the basic definitions over a general field `𝕂` and notation for `₂F₁`,
as well as showing that terms of the series are zero if any of the `(a b c : 𝕂)` are sufficiently
large non-positive integers, rendering the series finite. In this file "sufficiently large" means
that `-n < a` for the `n`-th term, and similarly for `b` and `c`.

- `ordinaryHypergeometricSeries` is the `FormalMultilinearSeries` given above for some `(a b c : 𝕂)`
- `ordinaryHypergeometric` is the sum of the series for some `(x : 𝔸)`
- `ordinaryHypergeometricSeries_eq_zero_of_nonpos_int` shows that the `n`-th term of the series is
  zero if any of the parameters are sufficiently large non-positive integers

## `[RCLike 𝕂]`

If we have `[RCLike 𝕂]`, then we show that the latter result is an iff, and hence prove that the
radius of convergence of the series is unity if the series is infinite, or `⊤` otherwise.

- `ordinaryHypergeometricSeries_eq_zero_iff` is iff variant of
  `ordinaryHypergeometricSeries_eq_zero_of_nonpos_int`
- `ordinaryHypergeometricSeries_radius_eq_one` proves that the radius of convergence of the
  `ordinaryHypergeometricSeries` is unity under non-trivial parameters

## Notation

`₂F₁` is notation for `ordinaryHypergeometric`.
