# Stirling's formula

This file proves Stirling's formula for the factorial.
It states that $n!$ grows asymptotically like $\sqrt{2\pi n}(\frac{n}{e})^n$.

Also some _global_ bounds on the factorial function and the Stirling sequence are proved.

## Proof outline

The proof follows: <https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_Formula>.

We proceed in two parts.

**Part 1**: We consider the sequence $a_n$ of fractions $\frac{n!}{\sqrt{2n}(\frac{n}{e})^n}$
and prove that this sequence converges to a real, positive number $a$. For this the two main
ingredients are
- taking the logarithm of the sequence and
- using the series expansion of $\log(1 + x)$.

**Part 2**: We use the fact that the series defined in part 1 converges against a real number $a$
and prove that $a = \sqrt{\pi}$. Here the main ingredient is the convergence of Wallis' product
formula for `π`.
