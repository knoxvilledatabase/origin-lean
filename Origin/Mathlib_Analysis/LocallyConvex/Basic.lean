# Local convexity

This file defines absorbent and balanced sets.

An absorbent set is one that "surrounds" the origin. The idea is made precise by requiring that any
point belongs to all large enough scalings of the set. This is the vector world analog of a
topological neighborhood of the origin.

A balanced set is one that is everywhere around the origin. This means that `a • s ⊆ s` for all `a`
of norm less than `1`.

## Main declarations

For a module over a normed ring:
* `Absorbs`: A set `s` absorbs a set `t` if all large scalings of `s` contain `t`.
* `Absorbent`: A set `s` is absorbent if every point eventually belongs to all large scalings of
  `s`.
* `Balanced`: A set `s` is balanced if `a • s ⊆ s` for all `a` of norm less than `1`.

## Main Results
* `Absorbent.submodule_eq_top` shows that when the base field is nontrivially normed, an absorbent
  submodule is actually the whole space. As an application, we show in
  `Absorbent.subset_image_iff_surjective` that a linear function is surjective if and only if its
  image contains an absorbent set.
