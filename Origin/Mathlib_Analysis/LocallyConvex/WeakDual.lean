# Weak Dual in Topological Vector Spaces

We prove that the weak topology induced by a bilinear form `B : E →ₗ[𝕜] F →ₗ[𝕜] 𝕜` is locally
convex and we explicitly give a neighborhood basis in terms of the family of seminorms
`fun x => ‖B x y‖` for `y : F`.

## Main definitions

* `LinearMap.toSeminorm`: turn a linear form `f : E →ₗ[𝕜] 𝕜` into a seminorm `fun x => ‖f x‖`.
* `LinearMap.toSeminormFamily`: turn a bilinear form `B : E →ₗ[𝕜] F →ₗ[𝕜] 𝕜` into a map
  `F → Seminorm 𝕜 E`.

## Main statements

* `LinearMap.hasBasis_weakBilin`: the seminorm balls of `B.toSeminormFamily` form a
  neighborhood basis of `0` in the weak topology.
* `LinearMap.toSeminormFamily.withSeminorms`: the topology of a weak space is induced by the
  family of seminorms `B.toSeminormFamily`.
* `WeakBilin.locallyConvexSpace`: a space endowed with a weak topology is locally convex.
* `LinearMap.rightDualEquiv`: When `B` is right-separating, `F` is linearly equivalent to the
  strong dual of `E` with the weak topology.
* `LinearMap.leftDualEquiv`: When `B` is left-separating, `E` is linearly equivalent to the
  strong dual of `F` with the weak topology.
