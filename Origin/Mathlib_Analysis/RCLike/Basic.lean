# `RCLike`: a typeclass for ℝ or ℂ

This file defines the typeclass `RCLike` intended to have only two instances:
ℝ and ℂ. It is meant for definitions and theorems which hold for both the real and the complex case,
and in particular when the real case follows directly from the complex case by setting `re` to `id`,
`im` to zero and so on. Its API follows closely that of ℂ.

Applications include defining inner products and Hilbert spaces for both the real and
complex case. One typically produces the definitions and proof for an arbitrary field of this
typeclass, which basically amounts to doing the complex case, and the two cases then fall out
immediately from the two instances of the class.

The instance for `ℝ` is registered in this file.
The instance for `ℂ` is declared in `Mathlib/Analysis/Complex/Basic.lean`.

## Implementation notes

The coercion from reals into an `RCLike` field is done by registering `RCLike.ofReal` as
a `CoeTC`. For this to work, we must proceed carefully to avoid problems involving circular
coercions in the case `K=ℝ`; in particular, we cannot use the plain `Coe` and must set
priorities carefully. This problem was already solved for `ℕ`, and we copy the solution detailed
in `Mathlib/Data/Nat/Cast/Defs.lean`. See also Note [coercion into rings] for more details.

In addition, several lemmas need to be set at priority 900 to make sure that they do not override
their counterparts in `Mathlib/Analysis/Complex/Basic.lean` (which causes linter errors).

A few lemmas requiring heavier imports are in `Mathlib/Analysis/RCLike/Lemmas.lean`.
